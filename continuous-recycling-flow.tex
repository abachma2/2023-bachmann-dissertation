    to advanced reactors with a continuous recycle fuel cycle. Before 2020 a once-through 
    fuel cycle is used with the facilities in blue. The fast reactors are deployed 
    starting in 2025, but the other facilities in red are deployed in 2020 to 
    develop a supply of reprocessed fuel for the fast reactors. }
