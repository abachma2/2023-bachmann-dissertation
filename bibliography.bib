Then, an optimization model including natural uranium requirements, spent fuel final disposal amounts and total cost of electricity generation is constructed and optimization problem under two scenarios of reprocessing capacity are solved and results discussed. The annual and cumulative natural uranium requirements under these two scenarios are also calculated. Finally some conclusions are put forward based on the analyses.},

	abstract = {The article presents a description and some illustrative results of the application of two optimization models for a two-component nuclear energy system consisting of thermal and fast reactors in a closed nuclear fuel cycle. These models correspond to two possible options of developing Russian nuclear energy system, which are discussed in the expert community: (1) thermal and fast reactors utilizing uranium and mixed oxide fuel, (2) thermal reactors utilizing uranium oxide fuel and fast reactors utilizing mixed nitride uranium-plutonium fuel. The optimization models elaborated using the IAEA MESSAGE energy planning tool make it possible not only to optimize the nuclear energy system structure according to the economic criterion, taking into account resource and infrastructural constraints, but also to be used as a basis for developing multi-objective, stochastic and robust optimization models of a two-component nuclear energy system. These models were elaborated in full compliance with the recommendations of the IAEA’s PESS and INPRO sections, regarding the specification of nuclear energy systems in MESSAGE. The study is based on publications of experts from NRC “Kurchatov Institute”, JSC “SSC RF-IPPE”, ITCP “Proryv”, JSC “NIKIET”. The presented results demonstrate the characteristic structural features of a two-component nuclear energy system for conservative assumptions in order to illustrate the capabilities of the developed optimization models. Consideration is also given to the economic feasibility of a technologically diversified nuclear energy structure providing the possibility of forming on its base a robust system in the future. It has been demonstrated that given the current uncertainties in the costs of nuclear fuel cycle services and reactor technologies, it is impossible at the moment to make a reasonable conclusion regarding the greatest attractiveness of a particular option in terms of the economic performance.},

This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted PWR fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the PWR fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. UNF inventory profile predicted by the model with the UDB UNF inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for UNF inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope GENeration (ORIGEN) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity PWR depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to NFC simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

	title = {Pebble bed reactor with equalised core power distribution inherently safe and simple},
	url = {https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/820874/},
	abstract = {Based an the physical properties of pebble bed reactors, a multitude of variations are possible in the layout of the fuel and fuelling schemes. These properties are being exploited in a conceptual design, offering an attractive layout in terms of the inter-related aspects of safety, economy and simplicity. Advantages of this layout are highlighted by means of a direct comparison to a similar reactor characterised by a conventional fuelling scheme. The proposed concept is characterised by the following: In the OTTO (\${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$nce \${\textbackslash}underline\{T\}\$hrough \${\textbackslash}underline\{T\}\$hen \${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$ut) fuelling scheme the fuel spheres pass through the core once only. Therefore the fuel recirculation subsystems may be negated in the design. The PAP2 (\${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$ower \${\textbackslash}underline\{A\}\$djusted by-\${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$oison) fuelling scheme involves adding of pebbles with burnable poison that will lead to a strong flattening of the axial core power density. These absorber spheres contain coated particles of B\$\_\{4\}\$C instead of fuel. In the radial direction flattening of the power density is achieved by increasing the loading of graphite spheres into the central fuelling channel (2-zone fuelling). The advantages of a relatively high power performance (250 MW\$\_\{th\}\$), a high heavy metal loading per fuel element (14g\$\_\{HM\}\$), and high burnup (120 MWd/Kg\$\_\{HM\}\$ can be directly translated into an economical advantage. Lowly enriched uranium is employed as fuel which provides a highly proliferation resistant solution when coupled to the high burnup and oncethrough only cycle. The control capability includes unlimited power variations within the operational range of 100-20-100\%. In the proposed concept the reactor is coupled to a power conversion unit which employs a direct cycle helium power turbine. - During a loss of coolant (DLOFC = Depressurised Loss Of Forced Coolant) event, the fuel element temperature is passively limited below 1600 °C, thus avoiding any radioactive release. Computationally the reactor is simulated by means of the VSOP (\${\textbackslash}underline\{V\}\$ery \${\textbackslash}underline\{S\}\$uperior \${\textbackslash}underline\{O\}\$ld \${\textbackslash}underline\{P\}\$rograms) staple of codes. For this purpose the following extensions to the code have been developed: A so-called onion-skin burnup model is introduced to calculate the burnup of the B\$\_\{4\}\$C kernels. Within the absorber spheres the burnup of the coated (B\$\_\{4\}\$C) particles are being followed in a nurnher of separate fiel zones. Based an experimental findings a fuel sphere flog scheine has been developed, which moves downward in parallel in the top area, while the bottorn area is re-organised in a funnel shape towards die de fuelling pipe in accordance with the angle of the conus and discharge rate. A 3-D geometric modeller, FIRZIT (i.e. in \${\textbackslash}phi\$-r-z-ordinates) has been exclusively developed for modelling the so-called noses, employed for housing the cold shut down system in a core with 3,5 m diarneter. This enables the modelling of various pebble flow schernes in azimuthal segments. [...] Mulder, E. J.},

The highly enriched uranium/thorium fuel cycle allows favourable utilization of the fissile reserves. For a conventional design the net consumption is 467 g/GWd(th), and this figure can be reduced to 58 g/GWd(th) for the advanced variant, achieving the breeding ratio 0.95. The advantage of the low enrichment uranium fuel cycle is the direct in situ utilization of the bred plutonium, being as high as 87\%, which reduces the demand for short-term recycling.

They can be deployed incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. SMRs show the promise of significant cost reduction through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability SMR designs and sizes are better suited for partial or dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some SMR designs may also serve niche markets, for example to burn nuclear waste. Booklets on the status of SMR technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of SMR designs.

	abstract = {Key components of a novel methodology and implementation of an agent-based, dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulator, Cyclus , are presented. The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, physics-dependent supply chain. To date, existing dynamic simulators have not treated constrained fuel supply, time-dependent, isotopic-quality based demand, or fuel fungibility particularly well. Utilizing an agent-based methodology that incorporates sophisticated graph theory and operations research techniques can overcome these deficiencies. This work describes a simulation kernel and agents that interact with it, highlighting the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), the supply-demand framework at the heart of the kernel. The key agent-DRE interaction mechanisms are described, which enable complex entity interaction through the use of physics and socio-economic models. The translation of an exchange instance to a variant of the Multicommodity Transportation Problem, which can be solved feasibly or optimally, follows. An extensive investigation of solution performance and fidelity is then presented. Finally, recommendations for future users of Cyclus and the DRE are provided.},

	abstract = {Although economics will certainly not be the only criterion for deploying fast reactors, it will be an important one. In this paper we will present a method for analysing their competitiveness in comparison with thermal neutron reactors. We will use the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) method to compare the production costs of each technology. For forecasting the uranium cost, which is an important question for competitiveness, we have proposed a model based on supply curve. This model approximates the uranium costs over the assumed 60-year operating lifetime of new reactors, according to their commissioning date. Concerning the fuel cycle costs, we have taken into account the fact that they will differ according to whether or not the reactor is in a country which has already chosen to treat and recycle spent fuel (back-end of the cycle). A uranium equivalent value is then calculated for which the kWh costs of each reactor technology would be the same. This enables us to determine the period when FRs will become competitive according to various parameters. The uranium supply curve appears to be the most influential parameter for any given nuclear demand, followed by the discount rate, prior choices regarding the back-end of the cycle, and the additional investment cost of FRs in comparison with PWRs.},

	abstract = {The nuclear fuel cycle is the series of stages that nuclear fuel materials go through in a cradle to grave framework. The Once Through Cycle (OTC) is the current fuel cycle implemented in the United States; in which an appropriate form of the fuel is irradiated through a nuclear reactor only once before it is disposed of as waste. The discharged fuel contains materials that can be suitable for use as fuel. Thus, different types of fuel recycling technologies may be introduced in order to more fully utilize the energy potential of the fuel, or reduce the environmental impacts and proliferation concerns about the discarded fuel materials. Nuclear fuel cycle systems analysis is applied in this paper to attain a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of fuel cycle alternatives. Through the use of the nuclear fuel cycle analysis code CAFCA (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycle Analysis), the impact of a number of recycling technologies and the associated fuel cycle options is explored in the context of the U.S. energy scenario over 100 years. Particular focus is given to the quantification of Uranium utilization, the amount of Transuranic Material (TRU) generated and the economics of the different options compared to the base-line case, the OTC option. It is concluded that LWRs and the OTC are likely to dominate the nuclear energy supply system for the period considered due to limitations on availability of TRU to initiate recycling technologies. While the introduction of U-235 initiated fast reactors can accelerate their penetration of the nuclear energy system, their higher capital cost may lead to continued preference for the LWR-OTC cycle.},

This work includes the first draft of a set of libraries that have been contibuted to the CYCLUS framework to enable a market-driven transition analysis. The CYCLUS simulation framework is incomplete without a suite of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabrication, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing, etc.). Within Cycamore, the additional modules repository within the CYCLUS ecosystem, provides some basic li- braries to represent these processes. However, extension of CYCLUS with new capabilities is community-driven, relying on contributions by user-developers. The libraries contributed in this work are examples of such contributions. This work relies heavily on the CycStub repository which included contributions from myself, Kathryn Huff, as well as Matthew Gidden, Anthony Scopatz, Robert Carlsen, Paul Wilson, and Olzhas Rahkimov at the University of Wisconsin - Madison within the Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG).},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supply–demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), has been designed implemented in CYCLUS. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the DRE allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the DRE enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

	abstract = {Dynamic fuel cycle simulation tools are intended to model holistic transient nuclear fuel cycle scenarios. As with all simulation tools, fuel cycle simulators require verification through unit tests, benchmark cases, and integral tests. Model validation is a vital aspect, as well. Although comparative studies have been performed, there is no comprehensive unit test and benchmark library for fuel cycle simulator tools. The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

EPR™ are only supplied with MOX (Mixed OXide) fuel to avoid the use of natural uranium. The equilibrium is studied by considering the flows of plutonium. Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the COSI6 simulation software. Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of EPR™ in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above. When EPR™ spent fuels are used in priority to supply SFR (distinct reprocessing), x reaches 0.2582 at most. COSI6 simulations have been performed to further assess these results. The EPR™ fraction in the fleet at symbiotic equilibrium barely depends on the applied reprocessing strategy, so that the more flexible joint reprocessing constitutes the reference option in that case.},

	abstract = {The UK Government has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80\% from 1990 levels by 2050. Achieving this goal may demand a significant expansion of nuclear power and the Government has been exploring some very challenging scenarios with up to 75 GWe of nuclear capacity by 2050. Prior to establishing a national R\&amp;D programme, the Government commissioned the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and the Dalton Nuclear Institute (DNI) to lead a preliminary R\&amp;D programme to fill in some gaps that have been identified. This initial R\&amp;D included a programme of work on Strategic Assessment, which will look at possible future energy and nuclear deployment scenarios to identify the important constraints and limitations. The nuclear expansion scenarios envisage a new build programme based on a Light Water Reactor (LWR) fleet and in some of these scenarios the LWRs are at some point replaced by a fleet of fast reactors with recycle that would allow a self-sustaining fuel cycle independent of world uranium supplies. This paper focuses on the high level conclusions that arise from the fast reactor scenarios studied. The high level conclusions relate to constraints on timescales for expansion of nuclear capacity and technical specifications for fuel cycle and waste management plants. In particular the work illustrates how the driving factors for fast reactor deployment have changed since the UK was last involved seriously in fast reactor development work in the mid-1990s.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle scenario analysis codes are valuable tools for investigating the effects of various decisions on the performance of the nuclear fuel cycle as a whole. Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the VISION fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various AFCI fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.

	abstract = {In support of the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign implemented by the US Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy, thermal and fast spectrum molten salt reactors (MSRs) were analyzed to assess performance of the reactor technology in various fuel cycles. These analyses include fuel cycles with (1) continuous recycle of U/Pu with new natural uranium fuel in fast critical reactors, (2) continuous recycle of U/Pu with new natural uranium fuel in both fast and thermal critical reactors, and (3) limited and continuous recycle of 233U/Th in thermal reactors. For each analysis, the evolution of the fuel salt was simulated for several years, and the fuel cycle metrics were calculated at the end of the simulation after equilibrium was achieved. Both thermal and fast spectrum MSRs performed well in replacing other technologies. Fuel cycle metrics highlight the impact of larger mass flow rates in MSRs due to their continuous treatment and separations of the fuel salt material. Liquid-fueled MSRs also provide a benefit in transition due to immediate availability of bred fissile material and low out-of-core time. Results from these analyses provide confidence that MSR technologies achieve adequate neutronic performance and may be used as an alternate reactor technology in the studied fuel cycles.},

It was followed by a non-linear programming (NLP) formulation which combines the ‘bottom-up’ technology model with a ‘top-down’ simplified macro-economic model. In recent years, the family was enlarged by members to model material flows, to employ stochastic programming (SP) to address future uncertainties, to model endogenous technology learning using mixed integer programming (MIP) techniques, and to model multiple regions (NLP/LP).},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

This paper shows that numerical optimization can be used to better identify impacts of fuel cycle policies and condense the generated data against a few significant criteria. The once-through cycle is considered the baseline case, while advanced technologies with fuel recycling characterize the alternative fuel cycle options available in the future. The options include, among others, recycling the fissile materials from spent light water reactor fuel in fast reactors (FRs) as well as deployment of innovative recycling reactor technologies, such as the 235U initiated FRs. Additionally, a first-of-a-kind optimization scheme for the nuclear fuel cycle analysis is described. Optimization metrics of interest to different stakeholders in the fuel cycle (economics, fuel resource utilization, high-level waste, transuranic materials/proliferation management, and environmental impact) are utilized for two different optimization techniques: a linear one and a stochastic one. Stakeholder elicitation provided sets of relative weights for the identified metrics appropriate to each stakeholder group, which were then used to demonstrate feasibility of arrival at optimum fuel cycle configurations for recycling technologies. The stochastic optimization tool, based on a genetic algorithm, was used to identify noninferior solutions according to Pareto’s dominance approach to optimization. The main trade-off for fuel cycle optimization was found to be between emphasizing economics versus most of the other identified metrics.},

Three diﬀerent fuel cycle scenarios involving PT technology were analyzed: 1) partitioning process only (separation of some ﬁssion products), 2) transmutation process only (separation and transmutation of minor actinides), and 3) both partitioning and transmutation. The necessary predisposal storage periods for some predeﬁned emplacement conﬁgurations were determined through transient thermal analysis, and the relation between the storage period and the emplacement area was obtained. For each scenario, we also estimated the storage capacity required for the dry storage of the heat-generating waste forms. The contributions of PT technology on the storage and disposal were discussed holistically, and we noted that the coupled introduction of partitioning and transmutation processes can bring an appreciable reduction in waste management size.},

	abstract = {With a view to providing supportive information for the decision-making on the direction of the future nuclear energy systems in Korea (i.e., direct disposal or recycling of spent nuclear fuel) to be made around 2020, quantitative studies on the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) including transuranic elements (TRUs) and a series of economic analyses were conducted. At first, the total isotopic inventory of TRUs in the SNF to be generated from all thirty-six units of nuclear power plants in operation or under planning is estimated based on the Korean government’s official plan for nuclear power development. Secondly, the optimized deployment strategies are proposed considering the minimum number of sodium cooled-fast reactors (SFRs) needed to transmute all TRUs. Finally, direct disposal and Pyro-SFR closed nuclear energy systems were compared using equilibrium economic model and considering reduction of TRUs and electricity generation as benefits. Probabilistic economic analysis shows that the assumed total generation cost for direct disposal and Pyro-SFR closed nuclear energy systems resides within the range of 13.60{\textbackslash}textasciitilde33.94 mills/kWh and 11.40{\textbackslash}textasciitilde25.91 mills/kWh, respectively. Dominant cost elements and the range of SFR overnight cost which guarantees the economic feasibility of the Pyro-SFR closed nuclear energy system over the direct disposal option were also identified through sensitivity analysis and break-even cost estimation.},

Indeed, sustainability is becoming the international reference approach to reconciling the different fields of analysis, i.e. the technical performance, economic viability, environmental preservation and societal acceptance. While our societies have to face the issue of finding new energy models which help to mitigate climate change, global approaches are mandatory to select the relevant improvements for the different energy systems, including nuclear energy. In a first step, this paper focuses on the specific environmental footprint of nuclear energy and its position with regards the other energy sources. From this situation, this paper depicts the potential improvement to be studied in order to improve the overall environmental footprint.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power can play an important role in our energy future, helping to meet increasing electricity demand while at the same time decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the nuclear fuel cycle in the United States today is unsustainable. The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act establishes the U.S. Department of Energy as responsible for disposing of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) generated by commercial nuclear power plants operating in a “once-through” fuel cycle in a deep geologic repository located at Yucca Mountain, NV. However, unyielding political opposition to the Yucca Mountain site has hindered the commissioning process to the extent that the current administration has recently declared the site unsuitable. In light of this, the DOE is exploring other options, including closing the fuel cycle through reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel. The possibility of closing the fuel cycle is receiving special attention because of its ability to minimize the final high level waste package by separating and isolating the most long-lived components, as well as recovering additional energy value from the original fuel. Reprocessing and recycling of SNF can decrease the volume of waste stored by a factor of 4 and reduce the timeframe of storage from hundreds of thousands of years to thousands of years. Reprocessing and recycling technologies are, however, still very controversial because of the increased cost and proliferation risk reprocessing can present. Estimates of increases in the levelized cost of electricity with reprocessing range from about 10\% to 50\% due to large uncertainties in the financing, construction, and licensing of a new plant. Ultimately, the U.S. will need to compare each of these fuel cycle options with respect to sustainability, proliferation risk, commercial viability, waste management, and energy security to define the future of nuclear power.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary to model complex nuclear fuel cycles (NFCs) and advanced reactor technologies. This thesis demonstrates the capability of CYCLUS , the agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies. The work in this thesis contains: (1) benchmarking Cyclus to other nuclear fuel cycle simulators (NFC simulators); (2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3) simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology transitions. The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include: (1) modeling and simulating past and current nuclear fleets using historic nuclear reactor operations database; (2) modeling individual reactors and their operating history to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) behavior in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation. Benchmark work shows that CYCLUS results coincide with results from other NFC simulators with minor differences due to modeling choices. Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the CYCLUS capability to effectively model and simulate real-life NFC transition scenarios that involve advanced reactor technologies such as MSRs.},

	abstract = {The present United States nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identi ed four classes of nuclear fuel cycle options the U.S could transition to, which would overcome these challenges and make nuclear energy technology more desirable. The transitions have been modeled by various nuclear fuel cycle simulators. However, most fuel cycle simulators require the user to define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid any supply chain gaps, which becomes tedious for complex transition scenarios. This thesis developed a capability in Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator, to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This new capability successfully deployed fuel cycle facilities in a transition scenario from the current light water reactor fleet to a closed fuel cycle with continuous recycling of transuranics in fast and thermal reactors. In reality, these transition scenarios inevitably diverge from the modeled scenario. This work coupled the nuclear fuel cycle simulator tools, Cyclus and DYMOND, with Dakota, a sensitivity analysis toolkit. This work conducted one-at-a-time, synergistic, and global sensitivity analysis with Cyclus-Dakota and DYMOND-Dakota, to understand the interdependence of input parameters on the transition performance from the current light water reactor eet to a closed fuel cycle in which transuranics are recycled to fuel mixed oxide fuel thermal reactors and sodium fast-cooled reactors. The global sensitivity analysis concluded that the transition year input parameter was the most influential to the final depleted uranium and total idle reactor capacity performance metrics, and the fleet share ratio and cooling time input parameters were the most influential to the final high level waste amount in the simulation. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis showed that varying transition year from 80 to 84 years increased the final depleted uranium amount by 1.13\% and reduced the total idle reactor capacity by 10.36\%. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis also showed that varying fleet share ratio (mixed oxide fuel light water reactor: sodium fast-cooled reactor) from 0:100 to 20:80 reduced the final high level waste amount by 2\%, and varying the used fuel cooling time from 0 to 8 years reduced the final high level waste amount by 4\%. Therefore, an optimized transition scenario that minimizes final high level waste amount, final depleted uranium amount, and total idle capacity must have a fleet share ratio of 20:80, used fuel cooling time of 8 years, and a transition year at 83 years. This work compared Cyclus-Dakota's and DYMOND-Dakota's sensitivity analysis capabilities and concluded that automated deployment of supporting fuel cycle facilities is crucial for conducting sensitivity analyses with nuclear fuel cycle simulators, to ensure that the simulation adapts to the new parameters by minimizing idle reactor capacity. The results demonstrated that time is saved if a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a nuclear fuel cycle transition scenario begins with a global sensitivity analysis study to gain a general overview of the influential input variables for the performance metrics. Then, based on the global sensitivity analysis results, a reduced number of one-at-a-time and synergistic sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine quantitative trends and impacts of influential input variables on the performance metrics.},

	abstract = {The present U.S. nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in nuclear fuel materials research, particularly on the topic of accident-tolerant fuels, have brought up potential opportunities for expanding the operating envelope of existing light water reactors. As many of the performance improvements offered by these technologies may be most fully realized by increasing fuel enrichment beyond the standard 5\% limit, this paper examines the potential reactor performance and fuel cycle performance of low-enriched uranium oxide fueled light water reactors by generically considering pressurized water reactors with 235U enrichment from 5 to 7\%. Advanced cladding, including accident-tolerant cladding, has the potential to increase fuel burnup limits related to hydrogen in the cladding that coincide with those limits associated with end-of-life reactivity. Therefore, higher enrichment will be necessary in order to realize the higher fuel burnups. This work includes evaluation of the fuel cycle length, discharge burnup, reactivity coefficients, and fuel cycle performance, including radioactive waste and environmental impact metrics per unit energy generated. The analysis was performed using the evaluation metrics from the US Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Study. The reactor performance and safety analysis show that enrichments between 5 and 7\% would have similar fuel temperature and moderator temperature coefficients. However, the soluble boron coefficient would decrease in magnitude, requiring more corrosive boric acid in the coolant or other methods of reactivity control during the fuel cycle. At these higher enrichments the maximum burnup at the rim of the fuel pellet would increase by almost a factor of two, which is expected to impact the formation of high-burnup structure in the fuel and the corresponding thermo-mechanical fuel properties. The fuel cycle performance assessment shows that increasing enrichment reduces the quantity of high-level waste disposed per unit energy generated, but it increases the natural resource requirements normalized to a gigawatt-electricity-per-year basis. Another impact is the slightly higher discharge burnup, resulting in somewhat different activity levels of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity at 100 and 100,000 years after fuel discharge. The environmental impacts—including land use, water use, carbon emission, and radiological exposure—are of the same magnitude per unit energy generated. However, the impacts are distributed differently. Less than 5\% enrichment has marginally more impact on the back-end of the fuel cycle, and greater than 5\% enrichment has marginally more impact on the front-end of the fuel cycle. Ultimately, no neutronic or reactor safety hindrances to employing light water reactor fuel with enrichments greater than 5\% are identified; given the achievable reactor performance benefits with advanced fuels, further practical exploration of increased enrichment fuel is recommended.},

	abstract = {We examine the potential fuel cycle performance of high assay low-enriched uranium fueled small light water reactors by considering several floating small reactor concepts of Russian origin with 235U enrichment at 10\%, 15\%, and 19.7\%. These enrichments are generic but representative of the reactor concepts being considered. The small reactor concepts were considered parametrically at two different power densities and neutron leakage fractions. The analysis was performed for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy using the evaluation metrics from the Evaluation and Screening (E\&S) Study. The reference reactor system in a once-through fuel cycle with an enrichment greater than 5\%, but less than 20\%, in the E\&S study is a graphite-moderated modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor (mHTGR). The neutron spectrum of an mHTGR is very different from these Russian floating small reactor concepts, which is why this analysis was conducted. The fuel cycle analysis indicates that increasing core leakage negatively impacts the natural resource requirements as well as the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity normalized to a giga-watt electric year (GWe-yr) basis. Further, we found that the 235U enrichment of the fuel and the rated core power density have limited fuel cycle performance impacts. One impact is the slightly higher discharge burnup of the de-rated power cases resulting in different spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity at 100 and 100,000 years after fuel discharge. The most significant result from the study is the observation that all the enrichment and power density cases resulted in decreased radioactivity at 100,000 years relative to the reference mHTGR example case with 15.5\%-enrichment from the E\&S study.},

	abstract = {The US Department of Energy Office of Fuel Cycle Technologies performed an evaluation and screening (E\&S) study of nuclear fuel cycle options to help prioritize future research and development decisions. Previous work for this E\&S study focused on establishing equilibrium conditionsfor analysis examples of40 nuclearfuel cycle evaluation groups (EGs) and evaluating their performance according to a set of 22 standardized metrics. Following the E\&S study, additional studies are being conducted to assess transitioningfrom the current USfuel cycle to future fuel cycle options identified by the E\&S study as being most promising. These studies help inform decisions on how to effectively achieve full transition, estimate the length of time needed to undergo transition from the current fuel cycle, and evaluate performance of nuclear systems and facilities in place during the transition. These studies also help identify any barriers to achieve transition. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fuel Cycle Options Campaign team used ORION to analyze the transition pathway from the existing US nuclear fuel cycle—the once-through use of low-enriched-uranium (LEU) fuel in thermal-spectrum light water reactors (LWRs) —to a new fuel cycle with continuous recycling ofplutonium and uranium in sodium fast reactors (SFRs). This paper discusses the analysis of the transition from an LWR to an SFR fleet using ORION, highlights the role of lifetime extensions of existing LWRs to aid transition, and discusses how a slight delay in SFR deployment can actually reduce the time to achieve an equilibrium fuel cycle.},

This work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios using Cyclus to compare how the type of the advanced reactor deployed and the energy growth demand affect the material requirements of the transition to High Assay Low Enriched Uranium-fueled reactors. Fuel cycle scenarios considered include the current fleet of Light Water Reactors in the U.S. as well as a no-growth and a 1\% growth transition to either the Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation Micro Modular Reactor or the X-energy Xe-100 reactor from the current fleet of U.S. Light Water Reactors. This work explored parameters of interest including the number of advanced reactors deployed, the mass of enriched uranium sent to the reactors, and the Separative Work Unit capacity required to enrich natural uranium for the reactors. Deploying Micro Modular Reactors requires a higher average mass and Separative Work Unit capacity than deploying Xe-100 reactors, and a lower enriched uranium mass and a higher Separative Work Unity capacity than required to fuel Light Water Reactors before the transition. Fueling Xe-100 reactors requires less enriched uranium and Separative Work Unit capacity than fueling Light Water Reactors before the transition.},

	abstract = {The voloxidation process was initially developed as a dry head-end method for removing tritium from spent uranium–plutonium reactor fuel prior to aqueous processing. Standard voloxidation of UO2-based fuels typically operates at temperatures between 500 and 600°C. This process converts the fuel into a fine U3O8 powder that can be easily separated from the cladding and completely releases tritium as tritiated water. A voloxidation process is being developed using these novel oxidising atmospheres: nitrogen dioxide, ozone and mixtures of the two. Un-irradiated pressurised water reactor uranium pellets and simulated fuel containing caesium iodide were used as surrogates. Treatment at significantly lower temperatures using a mixture of NO2/O2 or NO2/O3 produced a fine red powder of UO3 and released all the iodine (as I2) from the simulated fuel. This powder – containing the uranium as UO3, transuranium actinides and non-volatile fission product oxides – is readily soluble in dilute acid. For subsequent aqueous-based separations, these potential improvements can eliminate the prolonged dissolution step and mitigate the presence of iodine in processes downstream of voloxidation, thereby simplifying off-gas treatment. Both of these advantages should result in cost reductions. The fine UO3 powder separated from the cladding is also an excellent initial product for non-aqueous processing methods such as electrochemical separation in molten salts; halide volatility; DUPIC-like processes; supercritical CO2 dissolution; aqueous alkaline separations; and hybrid processes (for example, dry chlorination followed by aqueous washing)},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts has enhanced interest in building the tools necessary to analyze these systems. A Python script known as ChemTriton has been developed to simulate equilibrium MSR fuel cycle performance by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt using SCALE for neutron transport and depletion calculations. Improved capabilities in ChemTriton include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based MSR fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these MSRs to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on MSR operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-MSR system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

	abstract = {Since the construction of the first commercial nuclear power plant in 1957, the nuclear power industry has operated under the philosophy of economy of scale - the idea that increased power plant size accounts for higher economic efficiency. However, there has been a recent shift in direction; small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors are being considered as potentially wise investments for commercial power producers in that they can provide advantages that large-scale reactors may not possess in terms of reactor safety and investment risk. However, this may come at the risk of a higher levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). LCOE may be reduced by enriching the fuel passed its regulated limit of 5 wt\% (w/o) 235U. The high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel (5–20 w/o 235U) is introduced to increase the plant capacity factor, which thereby decrease fuel supply costs and reduce the LCOE. While decreasing plant LCOE seems like a clear advantage, several issues may result from increasing enrichments to the HALEU level in an SMR or micro-reactor design. This paper aims to shed light on these issues and address how they may affect the overall reactor design by using HALEU fuels in these reactors. This paper first discusses the notable effects on a reactor design with higher enrichment, then analyzes a SMR case study based on the NuScale’s 160 MWth SMR design. The case study reveals that the SMR with higher enriched fuel was able to double both fuel burnup and cycle time with an average core enrichment of 8.34 w/o and a maximum average assembly enrichment of 9.10 w/o. Moreover, this higher enriched core was found to operate with a maximum global peaking factor of 1.86, well below the published limit of 2.0. Likewise, the maximum axial flux offset of −2.4\% and the maximum boron concentration of 1757 ppm both remain within their respective safety constraints. Notable fission poisons, such as 149Sm and 135Xe, were also found to sharply increase in the HALEU core. Additionally, the average fuel temperature and peak cladding temperature fell within their respective safety constraints. Core-averaged flux, fluence, cladding creep, and post-shutdown decay heat were also investigated. Lastly, the higher enriched core was found to reduce LCOE by approximately 1.23 \$/MWh.},

	abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs) are currently being considered as future investments for commercial entities due to perceived advantages over traditional large-scale power reactors, particularly their considerably lower capital costs. One strategy for lowering the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of SMRs is to increase their burnup by utilizing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuels, which range from 5 to 20 weight percent (w/o) of U-235. By increasing fuel enrichment to HALEU levels, with higher specific fuel costs compared to standard enrichment, a plant may achieve an increased capacity factor by extending its fuel cycle and thereby reducing average yearly fuel supply costs. It is expected that the benefits of optimizing fuel enrichment to extend a reactor’s fuel cycle outweigh the added cost due to more expensive fuel. In this paper, the net benefit of extending an SMR’s fuel cycle by enriching uranium fuel to HALEU levels was estimated using 2017 nuclear fuel production market data with NuScale’s 160 MWt SMR design as a case study. It was found that, for NuScale’s design, plant LCOE decreased with increasing cycle length enabled by higher fuel enrichment. It was also observed that doubling cycle time from 24 months to 48 months netted each reactor a 1.23 \$/MWh reduction in LCOE. The total savings for a 12-module SMR design were estimated to be around \$5,840,000 per year. Therefore, utilizing HALEU fuel in SMRs can vastly improve their economic efficiency.},

The current approaches are typically based on the nodal diffusion codes that calculate criticality state points and power distributions as a function of burnup. The CASL VERA (Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors, Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications) code represents one of the latest advancements in 3D full-core calculation analysis based on transport theory methods employing the Method of Characteristics (MOC) and coupled multi-physics. In this article, a publicly released version of the NuScale reactor core is analysed with the VERA code (version 3.9 and 4.1) and contrasted against some static Serpent and Polaris based simulations. The analysis shows an excellent agreement for the lattice-level calculations as well as with some of the 3D full-core models. However, larger deviations were found in cases with heavy reflector models, whereby the reflector composition was found to impact the differences between the VERA and Serpent results. In this analysis, it was determined that greater than 90\% stainless steel content in the heavy reflector leads to higher deviations between the VERA results and the Serpent results. The burnup calculations showed that the presence of the heavy reflector extends the cycle length and also leads to a flatter power distribution in the core, which can generally be interpreted as more efficient.},

	title = {Sensitivity and {Uncertainty} {Quantification} of {Transition} {Scenario} {Simulations}},
	abstract = {This report documents the first collective attempt at developing and applying capabilities to quantify uncertainties, assess parametric sensitivities, and optimize multiple parameters and metrics in fuel cycle simulations generated by the SA\&I Campaign. To do this, external codes that were designed to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification (SA\&UQ) needed to be coupled to the SA\&I Campaign’s nuclear fuel cycle simulators (NFCS). In FY20, two approaches were pursued: 1) coupling Cyclus to an ORNL-internal code called MOT (Metaheuristic Optimization Tool) and 2) coupling DYMOND to the opensource SA\&UQ tool kit Dakota. The primary objective of having these NFCS/SA\&UQ coupled capabilities is to better inform DOE-NE and other stakeholders on the results generated from the NFCS. For a given set of fuel cycle strategies, policies, and technology assumptions that make up a fuel cycle scenario, these NFCS have traditionally been used by the SA\&I Campaign to provide quantitative answers in terms of year-by-year mass flows, infrastructure requirements, costs, etc. With these newly developed coupled capabilities, the SA\&I Campaign can now efficiently simulate hundreds or thousands of these scenarios, sample large ranges of parameters and assumptions, and use the unique features of the SA\&UQ tools to process the data. This enables providing answers with known and propagated uncertainties, determining the sensitivity of important metrics to different parameters and assumptions, quantifying how much fuel cycle and technology parameters impact each other, and producing optimized fuel cycle strategies for single and multiple variables. To demonstrate these new capabilities, the Cyclus/MOT was used to model several scenarios ranging from simple fleet retirements to transitions to advanced reactors. Specifically, for a transition scenario from LWRs to SFRs and advanced LWRs, uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, and optimization studies were applied to cases involving single and multiple parameter (input) and single and multiple metric (output) variations. In addition, a similar transition scenario was modeled to demonstrate how to optimize the reprocessing capacity parameter to minimize two performance metrics while taking into account uncertainties from two other parameters. Lastly, a depletion module based on SCALE/ORIGEN was added in Cyclus to simulate the third scenario that was designed to quantify the impact of the modeling assumption that all LWR used nuclear fuel have the same burnup. The newly developed DYMOND/Dakota capability was also applied to a transition scenario from the existing fleet to small modular reactors and fast reactors. This particular scenario involves not only explicit isotopic depletion via ORIGEN-2, but also includes multirecycling and utilizing the criticality search feature to determine the fresh fuel composition of recycled fuel, a feature unique to the DYMOND NFCS. A large database of simulations were run with 4 main parameters that were sampled: start date of reprocessing, reprocessing capacity, energy demand growth rate, and advanced reactor share of the fleet. The 4 main metrics were uranium consumption, enrichment requirements, waste generation, and levelized cost of electricity using data from the Cost Basis Report. The demonstrated SA\&UQ results include those that inform on how to choose parameters to avoid “failed” scenarios, Sobol’ indices that inform on the importance of various parameters individually and synergistically, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) studies that decompose parameter ranges into groups and informs on whether variations are statistically significant.},

	abstract = {The ability to perform sensitivity analysis has been enabled for the nuclear fuel cycle simulator DYMOND through its coupling with the design and analysis toolkit Dakota. To test and demonstrate these new capabilities, a transition scenario and multi-parameter study were devised. The transition scenario represents a partial transition from the US nuclear fleet to a closed fuel cycle with small modular LWRs and fast reactors fueled by reprocessed used nuclear fuel. Four uncertain parameters in this transition were studied – start date of reprocessing, total reprocessing capacity, the nuclear energy demand growth, and the rate at which the fast reactors are deployed – with respect to their impact on four response metrics. The responses – total natural uranium consumed, maximum annual enrichment capacity required, total disposed mass, and total cost of the nuclear fuel cycle – were chosen based on measures known to be of interest in transition scenarios [] and to be significantly impacted by the varying parameters. Analysis of this study was performed both from the direct sampling and through surrogate models developed in Dakota to calculate the global sensitivity measures Sobol’ indices. This example application of this new capability showed that the most consequential parameter to most metrics was the share of new build capacity that is fast reactors. However, for the cost metric, the scaling factor of the energy demand growth was significant and had synergistic behavior with the fast reactor new build share.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the difference in the value of the nuclear fuel cycle cost calculated by the deterministic and probabilistic methods on the basis of an equilibrium model. Calculating using the deterministic method, the direct disposal cost and Pyro-SFR (sodium-cooled fast reactor) nuclear fuel cycle cost, including the reactor cost, were found to be 66.41 mills/kWh and 77.82 mills/kWh, respectively (1 mill = one thousand of a dollar, i.e., 10−3 \$). This is because the cost of SFR is considerably expensive. Calculating again using the probabilistic method, however, the direct disposal cost and Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle cost, excluding the reactor cost, were found be 7.47 mills/kWh and 6.40 mills/kWh, respectively, on the basis of the most likely value. This is because the nuclear fuel cycle cost is significantly affected by the standard deviation and the mean of the unit cost that includes uncertainty. Thus, it is judged that not only the deterministic method, but also the probabilistic method, would also be necessary to evaluate the nuclear fuel cycle cost. By analyzing the sensitivity of the unit cost in each phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, it was found that the uranium unit price is the most influential factor in determining nuclear fuel cycle costs.},

	title = {Assessment of {Tools} and {Data} for {System}-{Level} {Dynamic} {Analyses}},
	abstract = {The only fuel cycle for which dynamic analyses and assessments are not needed is the null fuel cycle - no nuclear power. For every other concept, dynamic analyses are needed and can influence relative desirability of options. Dynamic analyses show how a fuel cycle might work during transitions from today's partial fuel cycle to something more complete, impact of technology deployments, location of choke points, the key time lags, when benefits can manifest, and how well parts of fuel cycles work together. This report summarizes the readiness of existing Fuel Cycle Technology (FCT) tools and data for conducting dynamic analyses on the range of options. VISION is the primary dynamic analysis tool. Not only does it model mass flows, as do other dynamic system analysis models, but it allows users to explore various potential constraints. The only fuel cycle for which constraints are not important are those in concept advocates PowerPoint presentations; in contrast, comparative analyses of fuel cycles must address what constraints exist and how they could impact performance. The most immediate tool need is extending VISION to the thorium/U233 fuel cycle. Depending on further clarification of waste management strategies in general and for specific fuel cycle candidates, waste management sub-models in VISION may need enhancement, e.g., more on 'co-flows' of non-fuel materials, constraints in waste streams, or automatic classification of waste streams on the basis of user-specified rules. VISION originally had an economic sub-model. The economic calculations were deemed unnecessary in later versions so it was retired. Eventually, the program will need to restore and improve the economics sub-model of VISION to at least the cash flow stage and possibly to incorporating cost constraints and feedbacks. There are multiple sources of data that dynamic analyses can draw on. In this report, 'data' means experimental data, data from more detailed theoretical or empirical calculations on technology performance, and assumptions such as the earliest date a technology can be deployed. The only fuel cycles for which we currently have adequate data are those we are sure we will never build, e.g., a PUREX plant in the U.S. For actual candidates, even for once through LWRs, there remain missing data such as how the fuel cycle would be completed with a geologic repository. The most immediate data needs are probably basic reactor physics data for new concepts and data associated with waste management for anything other than current technology. The readiness of tools and data is fluid and depends on what purposes are envisioned to drive upcoming analyses and further definition of the waste-related characteristics of fuel cycle candidates. Tools and data sets evolve as needs evolve. Thus, much of the document explains that if the FCT program wants a certain type of analysis, then the tools and data needs are as indicated. For example, functions can be treated as either commodities or facilities. Reactors, separation, fuel fabrication, repository are treated as facility types. Other functions such as uranium mining, conversion, enrichment, and waste packaging and non-repository disposal are treated as commodities and therefore not modeled as extensively. In summary, the tools are functional and can answer many fuel cycle questions but some analyses will require that the tools be modified to support those analyses.},

	abstract = {A system dynamics simulation technique is applied to generate a new version of the CAFCA code to study mass flows in the nuclear fuel cycle, and the impact of different options for advanced reactors and fuel recycling facilities on the inventory and distribution of transuranics (TRU). Several nuclear fuel cycle options are studied for U.S. and Brazil markets, and special consideration is given to potential collaboration between the two countries. This includes the impact of advanced nuclear technologies, under a prescribed growth in demand for nuclear electricity, on demand for uranium resources, uranium enrichment, and fuel reprocessing facilities, and on total cost of nuclear electricity over the next few decades. Introduction of fuel recycling reduces the growing demand for uranium, and the long-term need for storage of radioactive spent fuel. However, the timing of introduction of recycling is important for proper technology development, and the rate of deployment is restrained by the industrial capacity as well as the desire for high utilization factor of the deployed facilities over their life time, and that is reflected in the assessments. The nuclear fuel cycle is modeled as a high level structure diagram, which provides an overview of the interconnections among its blocks without showing all details, and as a structure-policy diagram which details the decision rules applied to the structure. The high level structure diagram represents the nuclear fuel cycle; the fleet of thermal and fast reactors; the separation and reprocessing plants; the waste repository; the spent fuel storage; and the paths for the fuel and waste mass transfer. In addition, an economic model is added to study different cases under the same assumptions. The economic model is based on the forecasted need for advanced reactors and recycling facilities, assuming that all costs are recovered within the nuclear energy system. Different recycling technology options are included in the code: (1) Thermal recycling in LWRs using Combined Non-Fertile and UO2 Fuel (CONFU), (2) Recycling of TRU in fertile-free fast cores of Actinide Burner Reactors (ABR); and (3) Fast recycling of TRU with UO[subscript 2] in self-sustaining Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFR). Case studies for different advanced technology introduction dates and for distinct TRU depletion rates are examined. In particular, the code is 3 equipped to simulate the introduction of two recycling technology options with a prescribed allocation of the TRU supply between them. The simulation results show that early introduction of the GFR recycling scheme leads to the most significant reduction in uranium consumption and enrichment requirements, thus delaying the eventual depletion date of uranium ore. The GFR requires less uranium resources due to the use of TRU as recycled fuel and near unity fissile conversion ratio. However, in a nonbreeding reactor system, the consumption of U continues to grow, and the TRU needed to start fast reactors will be growing at a constrained rate. On the other hand, the CONFU recycling scheme keeps the TRU inventory in the entire system well below other schemes, and guarantees equilibrium between the generation and consumption of transuranics without investments in fast reactors. CONFU incinerates more TRU than the GFR and ABR schemes during the simulation period. Also, it reduces the TRU sent to the repository for disposal by orders of magnitude. The ABR scheme does the same but requires the introduction of fast reactors. Nevertheless, the CONFU and ABR schemes have no significant impact on the amount of uranium resources consumption or enrichment requirements. Economic analysis indicates that the CONFU technology is more attractive at current uranium prices, and that fast recycling becomes as attractive as thermal recycling at higher uranium prices. The results also show that if a nuclear fuel cycle state/reactor state collaboration with Brazil is started, there will be a significant impact on the U.S. cumulative TRU inventory at interim storage, enrichment requirements, uranium consumption, and number of advanced fuel facilities. The results show that a nuclear partnership without the introduction of advanced nuclear technologies would not have advantages for the U.S. Furthermore, a nuclear collaboration allows a higher ratio of fast reactors to total installed nuclear electric capacity in the U.S.},

An optimization scheme of the nuclear fuel cycle is proposed.

	abstract = {For decades, nuclear energy development was based on the expectation that recycling of the fissionable materials in the used fuel from today's light water reactors into advanced (fast) reactors would be implemented as soon as technically feasible in order to extend the nuclear fuel resources. More recently, arguments have been made for deployment of fast reactors in order to reduce the amount of higher actinides, hence the longevity of radioactivity, in the materials destined to a geologic repository. The cost of the fast reactors, together with concerns about the proliferation of the technology of extraction of plutonium from used LWR fuel as well as the large investments in construction of reprocessing facilities have been the basis for arguments to defer the introduction of recycling technologies in many countries including the US. In this thesis, the impacts of alternative reactor technologies on the fuel cycle are assessed. Additionally, metrics to characterize the fuel cycles and systematic approaches to using them to optimize the fuel cycle are presented. The fuel cycle options of the 2010 MIT fuel cycle study are re-examined in light of the expected slower rate of growth in nuclear energy today, using the CAFCA (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycle Analysis). The Once Through Cycle (OTC) is considered as the base-line case, while advanced technologies with fuel recycling characterize the alternative fuel cycle options available in the future. The options include limited recycling in L WRs and full recycling in fast reactors and in high conversion LWRs. Fast reactor technologies studied include both oxide and metal fueled reactors. Additional fuel cycle scenarios presented for the first time in this work assume the deployment of innovative recycling reactor technologies such as the Reduced Moderation Boiling Water Reactors and Uranium-235 initiated Fast Reactors. A sensitivity study focused on system and technology parameters of interest has been conducted to test the robustness of the conclusions presented in the MIT Fuel Cycle Study. These conclusions are found to still hold, even when considering alternative technologies and different sets of simulation assumptions. Additionally, a first of a kind optimization scheme for the nuclear fuel cycle analysis is proposed and the applications of such an optimization are discussed. Optimization metrics of interest for different stakeholders in the fuel cycle (economics, fuel resource utilization, high level waste, transuranics/proliferation management, and environmental impact) are utilized for two different optimization techniques: a linear one and a stochastic one. Stakeholder elicitation provided sets of relative weights for the identified metrics appropriate to each stakeholder group, which were then successfully used to arrive at optimum fuel cycle configurations for recycling technologies. The stochastic optimization tool, based on a genetic algorithm, was used to identify non-inferior solutions according to Pareto's dominance approach to optimization. The main tradeoff for fuel cycle optimization was found to be between economics and most of the other identified metrics.

	abstract = {The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) designed and constructed the high temperature engineering test reactor (HTTR) in order to establish and upgrade the technology basis for the high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) and develop the technology for high temperature heat applications. The HTTR is a helium-cooled and graphite-moderated HTGR with a thermal power of 30MW and a maximum reactor outlet coolant temperature of 950°C. The first criticality was attained on November 10, 1998 and the rated power operation with the reactor outlet coolant temperature of 850°C was achieved on December 7, 2001. Since 2002, safety demonstration tests simulating anticipated operational occurrences such as decrease of primary coolant flow-rate and reactivity insertion have been carried out to ensure safety during off-normal conditions. From 2005, various irradiation tests for fuels and materials will start. In addition, a hydrogen production test facility will be coupled with the HTTR by 2015 to produce hydrogen by nuclear. The history and future plan, major design features and R\&D programs of the HTTR are summarized in this paper.},

	abstract = {Coated particle fuel concepts date back some 60 years, and have evolved significantly from the relatively primitive pyrocarbon-coated kernels envisioned by the first pioneers. Improvements in particle design, coating layer properties, and kernel composition have produced the modern tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particle, capable of low statistical coating failure fractions and good fission product retention under extremely severe conditions, including temperatures of 1600 °C for hundreds of hours. The fuel constitutes one of the key enabling technologies for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, allowing coolant outlet temperatures approaching 1000 °C and contributing to enhanced reactor safety due to the hardiness of the particles. TRISO fuel development has taken place in a number of countries worldwide, and several fuel qualification programs are currently in progress. In this paper, we discuss the unique history of particle fuel development and some key technology advances, concluding with some of the latest progress in UO2 and UCO TRISO fuel qualification.},

	url = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1504421},
	abstract = {Nuclear energy technology developers seek to bring to market new advanced reactor designs and new light water reactor fuel designs, many of which would deploy fuel made from uranium with 235U enrichment ranging from 5\% to 19.75\%. There is currently no commercial supply of uranium in this enrichment range, which is higher than used in today’s light water reactors but still lower than the safeguards limit of 20\% 235U. This limitation is a barrier to development of demonstration of these new nuclear energy technologies. As a means to address this near-term need, DOE and Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has considered how the HALEU product from sodium-bonded spent fuel treatment in the INL Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF), located at the Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC), might be provided and fabricated into some of the new fuel designs. The evaluation presented in this report addresses the potential establishment of two types of fuel fabrication capability at INL, represented generically as a ceramic-type (or pellet-type) fuel fabrication line and a metallic fuel fabrication line. Because the FCF HALEU feedstock contains residual transuranic contamination and a relatively small amount of residual fission products, fabrication with that material is necessarily performed inside of engineered confinement barriers, such as gloveboxes, which would be filled with inert gas for most of the fuel types considered. The throughput rate of the fabrication lines envisioned is 2.5 metric tons of HALEU fuel per year, which is judged to be sufficiently representative of engineering-scale. Space in three existing buildings was identified for consideration in this study of pre-conceptual equipment layouts. The scope and nature of the work needed to prepare each of the three buildings for each type of fuel fabrication was identified (though not in engineering detail), and three-dimensional models of envisioned fabrication equipment were laid out in each of the buildings to assess adequacy of space. The study concluded that either type of fuel fabrication line can feasibly be installed and operated in either of the three buildings. However, each of the three buildings presents different challenges in preparation, due to accommodating current missions that would need to be relocated or necessary decontamination and decommissioning work to free-up space for fuel fabrication, or due to complications of accessibility. Rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for preparing buildings begin at \$10M ( 20\%/+50\%) and would increase with increased complexity of building modifications. The cost of fabrication equipment and gloveboxes is roughly estimated to be \$21M (-20\%/+50\%) for a metallic fuel fabrication line and \$27M (-20\%/+50\%) for a ceramic/intermetallic fuel fabrication line. Nominal operating costs are estimated to be \$7M per year (in 2019 dollars), increasing from lower amounts needed as the operating crew is being assembled and trained.},

The chapter entitled, Gaseous diffusion, discusses this process which is the main industrial process for uranium enrichment today as well as an in depth treatment of the gas flow through the porous barrier and the relevant separation effects. The chapter on the centrifugation process covers essentially the conceptual and theoretical aspects of the process. An overall description of the separation nozzle process including both the physical principle and the technical aspects are discussed. The last two chapters in the book are devoted to new methods of uranium separation which are still in the laboratory stage. The laser method in which separation is obtained through selective photoexcitation of uranium atoms or molecules is treated in one chapter, and the other chapter deals with separation experiments with rotating plasmas and some advanced concepts like using ion cyclotron resonance effects to achieve isotope separation.

Simultaneously, the nations that host enrichment facilities strongly discourage other nations from developing enrichment capacity, given its potential use in nuclear weapons production. Therefore, these four firms benefit from the exercise of national power to prevent entry into this market. This paper shows that these firms also benefit from increasing returns to scale. In similar national situations, this industry would be regulated or nationalized. This is because free markets do not necessarily lead to a socially optimal long-run equilibrium where the industry is necessarily concentrated, such that there is no proliferating entry, but is sufficiently diverse, so that no one national group can dictate prices, contract terms, or non-proliferation policy. Therefore, some form of international regulation might be necessary to discourage enrichment technology proliferation and assure enrichment supply at reasonable prices.},

The isotope enrichment which results from the superposition of the elementary separation effect due to the centrifugal field in the gas and its internal circulation is analyzed by the Onsager-Cohen theory.

In this study, five kinds of fuel cycles were investigated. Required uranium enrichment, required natural uranium amount, and toxicity of heavy metals (HMs) in spent fuel were presented for comparison. The results showed that the enrichment and the required amount of natural uranium decrease significantly with increasing number of confined heavy nuclides when uranium is discharged from the reactor. On the other hand, when uranium is totally confined, the enrichment becomes extremely high. The confinement of plutonium and minor actinides (MA) seems effective in reducing radio-toxicity of discharged wastes. By confining all heavy nuclides except uranium those three characteristics could be reduced considerably. For this fuel cycle the toxicity of HMs in spent fuel become nearly equal to or less than that of loaded uranium.},

This comparison was made to suggest an economic competitive fuel cycle for the Republic of Korea. The fuel cycle cost (FCC) has been calculated based on the equilibrium material flows integrated with the unit cost of the fuel cycle components. The levelized fuel cycle costs (LFCC) have been derived in terms of mills/kWh for a fair comparison among the FCCs, and the results are as follows: OT 7.35 mills/kWh, DUPIC 9.06 mills/kWh, PUREX-MOX 8.94 mills/kWh, and Pyro-SFR 7.70 mills/kWh. Due to unavoidable uncertainties, a cost range has been applied to each unit cost, and an uncertainty study has been performed accordingly. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to obtain the break-even uranium price (215\$/kgU) for the Pyro-SFR against the OT, which demonstrates that the deployment of the Pyro-SFR may be economical in the foreseeable future. The influence of pyrotechniques on the LFCC has also been studied to determine at which level the potential advantages of Pyro-SFR can be realized.},

	abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs) may offer potential benefits relative to large light water reactors, such as enhanced flexibility in deployment and operation. However, it is vital to understand the holistic impact of SMRs on nuclear fuel cycle performance. The focus of this paper is the fuel cycle impacts of light water SMRs in a once-through fuel cycle with low-enriched uranium fuel. A key objective of this paper is to describe preliminary neutronics and fuel cycle analyses conducted in support of the US Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Fuel Cycle Options Campaign. The hypothetical light water SMR example case considered in these preliminary scoping studies is a “cartridge type” one-batch core with slightly less than 5.0\% enrichment. The high-level issues identified and preliminary scoping calculations in this paper are intended to inform decision makers regarding potential fuel cycle impacts of one-batch thermal-spectrum SMRs. In particular, this paper highlights the impact of increased neutron leakage and a reduced number of batches on the achievable burnup of the reactor. Fuel cycle performance metrics for the simplified example SMR analyzed herein are compared with those for a conventional three-batch light water reactor (LWR) in the following areas: nuclear waste management, environmental impact, and resource utilization. The metrics performance for such an SMR is degraded for the mass of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste disposed of per energy generated, mass of depleted uranium disposed of per energy generated, land use per energy generated, and carbon emissions per energy generated. Finally, it is noted that the features of some SMR designs impact three main aspects of fuel cycle performance: (1) small cores, which mean high leakage (there is a radial and an axial component); (2) a heterogeneous core and extensive use of control rods and burnable poisons; and (3) single-batch cores. But not all SMR designs have all of these traits. The approach used in this study is an example bounding case, and not all SMRs may be impacted to the same extent.},

	abstract = {Previous estimates of environmental impacts associated with the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle (FEFC) have focused primarily on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Results have varied widely. This work builds upon reports from operating facilities and other primary data sources to build a database of front end environmental impacts. This work also addresses land transformation and water withdrawals associated with the processes of the FEFC. These processes include uranium extraction, conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication, depleted uranium disposition, and transportation. To allow summing the impacts across processes, all impacts were normalized per tonne of natural uranium mined as well as per MWh(e) of electricity produced, a more conventional unit for measuring environmental impacts that facilitates comparison with other studies. This conversion was based on mass balances and process efficiencies associated with the current once-through LWR fuel cycle. Total energy input is calculated at 8.7×10−3 GJ(e)/MWh(e) of electricity and 5.9×10−3 GJ(t)/MWh(e) of thermal energy. It is dominated by the energy required for uranium extraction, conversion to fluoride compound for subsequent enrichment, and enrichment. An estimate of the carbon footprint is made from the direct energy consumption at 1.7kg CO2/MWh(e). Water use is likewise dominated by requirements of uranium extraction, totaling 154L/MWh(e). Land use is calculated at 8×10−3m2/MWh(e), over 90\% of which is due to uranium extraction. Quantified impacts are limited to those resulting from activities performed within the FEFC process facilities (i.e. within the plant gates). Energy embodied in material inputs such as process chemicals and fuel cladding is identified but not explicitly quantified in this study. Inclusion of indirect energy associated with embodied energy as well as construction and decommissioning of facilities could increase the FEFC energy intensity estimate by a factor of up to 2.},

The present level of carbon displacement is approximately 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year (GtC/year), compared to the nearly 8 GtC/year emitted by the use of fossil fuels. However, there are three major negative environmental impacts of nuclear power: catastrophic accidents, nuclear weapons, and nuclear waste. The last two, weapons and waste, are directly tied to the type of nuclear fuel cycle (Figure 4 in the main nuclear article by Raj et al. in this issue).

	abstract = {The following report provides a rich resource of information for exploring fuel cycle characteristics. The most noteworthy trends can be traced back to the utilization efficiency of natural uranium resources. By definition, complete uranium utilization occurs only when all of the natural uranium resource can be introduced into the nuclear reactor long enough for all of it to undergo fission. Achieving near complete uranium utilization requires technologies that can achieve full recycle or at least nearly full recycle of the initial natural uranium consumed from the Earth. Greater than 99\% of all natural uranium is fertile, and thus is not conducive to fission. This fact requires the fuel cycle to convert large quantities of non-fissile material into fissile transuranics. Step increases in waste benefits are closely related to the step increase in uranium utilization going from non-breeding fuel cycles to breeding fuel cycles. The amount of mass requiring a disposal path is tightly coupled to the quantity of actinides in the waste stream. Complete uranium utilization by definition means that zero (practically, near zero) actinide mass is present in the waste stream. Therefore, fuel cycles with complete (uranium and transuranic) recycle discharge predominately fission products with some actinide process losses. Fuel cycles without complete recycle discharge a much more massive waste stream because only a fraction of the initial actinide mass is burned prior to disposal. In a nuclear growth scenario, the relevant acceptable frequency for core damage events in nuclear reactors is inversely proportional to the number of reactors deployed in a fuel cycle. For ten times the reactors in a fleet, it should be expected that the fleet-average core damage frequency be decreased by a factor of ten. The relevant proliferation resistance of a fuel cycle system is enhanced with: decreasing reliance on domestic fuel cycle services, decreasing adaptability for technology misuse, enablement of material accountability, and decreasing material attractiveness.},

LCA (life cycle analysis) is a structured basis for deriving relevant indicators which can allow the comparison of a wide range of impacts of different energy sources. Among the energy-mix, nuclear power is anticipated to have very low GHG-emissions. However, its viability is severely addressed by the public opinion after the Fukushima accident. Therefore, a global LCA of the French nuclear fuel cycle was performed as a reference model. Results were compared in terms of impact with other energy sources. It emphasized that the French nuclear energy is one of the less impacting energy, comparable with renewable energy. In a second, part, the French scenario was compared with an equivalent open fuel cycle scenario. It demonstrates that an open fuel cycle would require about 16\% more natural uranium, would have a bigger environmental footprint on the “non radioactive indicators” and would produce a higher volume of high level radioactive waste.},

With the retirement of diffusion enrichment facilities, enrichment prices have declined by one-third since 2009 and are likely to remain below \$100-kgSWU for the foreseeable future. Here, initial uranium prices are set at \$90/kgU and reprocessing costs at \$2500 per kilogram of heavy-metal throughput, representative of “new-build” costs for reprocessing facilities. Substantial reprocessing cost reductions must be achieved if MOX is to be competitive, i.e., if it is to improve the sustainability of the LWR. However, results indicate that preserving the MOX alternative for spent fuel management later in this century has a large present value under several sets of assumptions regarding uranium price increases and reprocessing cost decreases.},

The closed fuel cycle improve sustainability in terms of the supply certainty of uranium and involves less long-term radiological risks and proliferation concerns. However, it compromises short-term public health and safety and security, due to the separation of plutonium. The trade-offs in nuclear energy are reducible to a chief trade-off between the present and the future. To what extent should we take care of our produced nuclear waste and to what extent should we accept additional risks to the present generation, in order to diminish the exposure of future generation to those risks? The advocates of the open fuel cycle should explain why they are willing to transfer all the risks for a very long period of time (200,000 years) to future generations. In addition, supporters of the closed fuel cycle should underpin their acceptance of additional risks to the present generation and make the actual reduction of risk to the future plausible.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fission is receiving new attention as a developed source of carbon-free energy. A much larger number of nuclear reactors would be needed for a major impact on carbon emission. The crucial question is whether it can be done without increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation. Specifically, can a larger nuclear share in world energy production, well above the present 6\%, be achieved in the next few decades without adding the proliferation-sensitive technologies of reprocessing spent fuel and recycling plutonium to the problems of the unavoidable use of enrichment technology? The answer depends on the available uranium resources. We first looked for the maximum possible nuclear build-up in the 2025–2065 period under the constraints of the estimated uranium resources and the use of once-through nuclear fuel technology. Our results show that nuclear energy without reprocessing could reduce carbon emission by 39.6\% of the total reduction needed to bring the WEO 2009 Reference Scenario prediction of total GHG emissions in 2065 to the level of the WEO 450 Scenario limiting global temperature increase to 2°C. The less demanding strategy of the nuclear replacement of all non-CCS coal power plants retiring during the 2025–2065 period would reduce emission by 26.1\%.},

This study is aimed at examining the feasibility of reprocessed uranium (RepU) with or without the addition of minor actinide (MA) in LWR fuel cycle for PPP and to make a tentative economic assessment of RepU possessing the PPP feature. It was analytically clarified that RepU enriched to 5\% 235U by centrifugation produced denatured Pu at higher burnup than about 40GWd/t. By the addition of more than 0.5\% MA to RepU and natural uranium both enriched to 5\%, Pu generated in the uranium fuel with MA added could be denatured up to 40 GWd/t at least. A diagram designed with functions of SFN rate and DH explicated the PPP features of re-enriched RepU and enriched natural uranium with or without MA addition. The economic assessment indicated that the cost of fuel cycle applying re-enriched RepU would be comparable to that of the conventional fuel cycle, if the cost of the source RepU is low. In addition, the LWR fuel cycle applying RepU for PPP was discussed.},

The proposed framework of analysis illustrates some of the key features of the market for this commodity, including the role that time lags play in the formation of price volatility. Various demand reduction and substitution strategies and technologies are explored, and potential external shocks are simulated to investigate how price and the associated industry respond. Sensitivity analysis performed by considering key model parameters indicates that the time constant related to the formation of traders’ expectations of future market prices embedded in the proposed price discovery mechanism has a strong influence on both the amplitude and frequency of price peaks. One particularly interesting and timely scenario simulated is the possibility of the ending of the “Megatons to Megawatts” program, in which the USA agreed to buy down-blended uranium from former Soviet nuclear warheads for use in power production. This agreement has not been formally renewed and we find that in the absence of new substitute sources this could cause a significant rise in uranium prices. Finally, our analysis leads us to believe that uranium resource scarcity will not pose any significant challenges until the second half of the twenty first century at the earliest, even if high uranium demand projections are realized.},

A nuclear fuel cycle study could give convincing answers to many questions in regard to technical aspects. However, one nuclear fuel cycle option cannot be superior in all aspects. Therefore a nation must identify its top priority and accordingly evaluate all the possible nuclear fuel cycle options. For such a purpose, this paper examined four different fuel cycle options that are likely to be plausible under situation of Republic of Korea: once-through cycle, DUPIC recycling, thermal recycling using MOX fuel in PWR (pressurized water reactor), and SFR (sodium cooled fast reactor) employing fuel recycling by a pyroprocess. The options have been quantitatively compared in terms of resource utilization and waste generation based on 1TWh electricity production at a “steady-state” condition as a basic analysis. This investigation covered from the front-end of the fuel cycles to the final disposal and showed that the Pyro-SFR recycling appears to be the most competitive from these material quantitative aspects due to the reduction of the required uranium resources and the least amount of waste generation.},

	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/75166},
	abstract = {The once through nuclear fuel cycle adopted by the majority of countries with operating commercial power reactors imposes a number of concerns. The radioactive waste created in the once through nuclear fuel cycle has to be isolated from the environment for thousands of years. In addition, plutonium and other actinides, after the decay of fission products, could become targets for weapon proliferators. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the energy potential in the fuel is being used. All these concerns can be addressed if a closed fuel cycle strategy is considered offering the possibility for partitioning and transmutation of long lived radioactive waste, enhanced proliferation resistance, and improved utilization of natural resources. It is generally believed that dedicated advanced reactor systems have to be designed in order to perform the task of nuclear waste transmutation effectively. The development and deployment of such innovative systems is technically and economically challenging. In this work, a possibility of constraining the generation of long lived radioactive waste through multi-recycling of Trans-uranic actinides (TRU) in existing Light Water Reactors (LWR has been studied. Thorium based and fertile free fuels (FFF) were analyzed as the most attractive candidates for TRU burning in LWRs. Although both fuel types can destroy TRU at comparable rates (about 1150 kg/GWe-Year in FFF and up to 900 kg/GWe-Year in Th) and achieve comparable fractional TRU burnup (close to 50a/o), the Th fuel requires significantly higher neutron moderation than practically feasible in a typical LWR lattice to achieve such performance. On the other hand, the FFF exhibits nearly optimal TRU destruction performance in a typical LWR fuel lattice geometry. Increased TRU presence in LWR core leads to neutron spectrum hardening, which results in reduced control materials reactivity worth. The magnitude of this reduction is directly related to the amount of TRU in the core. A potential for positive void reactivity feedback limits the maximum TRU loading. Th and conventional mixed oxide (MOX) fuels require higher than FFF TRU loading to sustain a standard 18 fuel cycle length due to neutron captures in Th232 and U238 respectively. Therefore, TRU containing Th and U cores have lower control materials worth and greater potential for a positive void coefficient than FFF core. However, the significantly reduced fuel Doppler coefficient of the fully FFF loaded core and the lower delayed neutron fraction lead to questions about the FFF performance in reactivity initiated accidents. The Combined Non-Fertile and UO[subscript 2] (CONFU) assembly concept is proposed for multirecycling of TRU in existing PWRs. The assembly assumes a heterogeneous structure where about 20\% of the UO[subscript 2] fuel pins on the assembly periphery are replaced with FFF pins hosting TRU generated in the previous cycle. The possibility of achieving zero TRU net is demonstrated. The concept takes advantage of superior TRU destruction performance in FFF allowing minimization of TRU inventory. At the same time, the core physics is still dominated by UO[subscript 2] fuel allowing maintenance of core safety and control characteristics comparable to all-UO[subscript 2]. A comprehensive neutronic and thermal hydraulic analysis as well as numerical simulation of reactivity initiated accidents demonstrated the feasibility of TRU containing LWR core designs of various heterogeneous geometries. The power peaking and reactivity coefficients for the TRU containing heterogeneous cores are comparable to those of conventional UO[subscript 2] cores. Three to five TRU recycles are required to achieve an equilibrium fuel cycle length and TRU generation and destruction balance. A majority of TRU nuclides reach their equilibrium concentration levels in less than 20 recycles. The exceptions are Cm246, Cm248, and Cf252. Accumulation of these isotopes is highly undesirable with regards to TRU fuel fabrication and handling because they are very strong sources of spontaneous fission (SF) neutrons. Allowing longer cooling times of the spent fuel before reprocessing can drastically reduce the SF neutron radiation problem due to decay of Cm244 and Cf252 isotopes with particularly high SF source. Up to 10 TRU recycles are likely to be feasible if 20 years cooling time between recycles is adopted. Multi-recycling of TRU in the CONFU assembly reduces the relative fraction of fissile isotopes in the TRU vector from about 60\% in the initial spent UO[subscript 2] to about 25\% at equilibrium. As a result, the fuel cycle length is reduced by about 30\%. An increase in the enrichment of UO[subscript 2] pins from 4.2 to at least 5\% is required to compensate for the TRU isotopics degradation. The environmental impact of the sustainable CONFU assembly based fuel cycle is limited by the efficiency of TRU recovery in spent fuel reprocessing. TRU losses of 0.1\% from the CONFU fuel reprocessing ensure the CONFU fuel cycle radiotoxicity reduction to the level of corresponding amount of original natural uranium ore within 1000 years. The cost of the sustainable CONFU based fuel cycle is about 60\% higher than that of the once through UO[subscript 2] fuel cycle, whereas the difference in total cost of electricity between the two cycles is only 8\%. The higher fuel cycle cost is a result of higher uranium enrichment in a CONFU assembly required to compensate for the degradation of TRU isotopics and cost of reprocessing. The major expense in the sustainable CONFU fuel cycle is associated with the reprocessing of UO[subscript 2] fuel. Although reprocessing and fabrication of FFF pins have relatively high unit costs, their contribution to the fuel cycle cost is marginal as a result of the small TRU throughput. Reductions in the unit costs of UO[subscript 2] reprocessing and FFF fabrication by a factor of two would result in comparable fuel cycle costs for the CONFU and conventional once through cycle. An increase in natural uranium prices and waste disposal fees will also make the closed fuel cycle more economically attractive. Although, the cost of the CONFU sustainable fuel cycle is comparable to that of a closed cycle using a critical fast actinide burning reactor (ABR), the main advantage of the CONFU is the possibility of fast deployment, since it does not require as extensive development and demonstration as needed for fast reactors. The cost of the CONFU fuel cycle is projected to be considerably lower than that of a cycle with an accelerator driven fast burner system.},

The main driver for such evolution is the need for improving the sustainability of global energy systems. Indeed, sustainability is becoming the international reference approach to reconciling the different fields of analyses; that is, technical performance, economic viability, environmental preservation, and societal acceptance. While our societies have to face the issue of finding new energy models that help to mitigate climate change, global approaches are mandatory to select the relevant improvements for the different energy systems, including nuclear energy. After describing world energy issues, this chapter will detail the relevant criteria that could be used to assess the respective values of the different energy systems and will describe how nuclear energy could improve its contribution to sustainability by shifting toward a more efficient recycling, with different steps toward potential implementation.},

In recent years, these issues have led to a rise in public opposition in some countries and, thus, nuclear energy has been facing even more challenges. However, continuous efforts in R\&D (research and development) are resulting in new spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management technologies that might be the pathway towards helping the environment and the sustainability of nuclear energy. Thus, reprocessing and recycling of SNF could be one of the key points to improve the social acceptability of nuclear energy. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the state of the nuclear waste management technologies, its evolution through time and the future advanced techniques that are currently under research, in order to obtain a global vision of the nuclear fuel cycle strategies available, their advantages and disadvantages, and their expected evolution in the future.},

Since the second uranium recycle there is a problem of full return of the recycled uranium to LWR fuel cycle due to significant increasing of 232 U concentration and strong regulatory restrictions on its content. The paper shows that the use of a double cascade is able to provide almost complete return of recycled uranium to the fuel cycle with minor losses. The reason for the losses is the necessity to clean the recycled uranium from the 232 U isotope. We developed a multicriteria approach to choosing the optimal cascade scheme parameters. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by the example of enrichment of the recycled uranium of the second recycle. It is shown that not correctly selected optimization criteria of the double cascade enrichment scheme can lead to the fact that the loss of the 235 U isotope, provided with waste treatment from 232 U, will exceed its savings.},

The uranium price at which reprocessing spent fuel from light water reactors (LWRs) and recycling the resulting plutonium and uranium in LWRs would become economic is estimated for a range of reprocessing prices and other fuel cycle costs. The contribution of both fuel cycle options to the cost of electricity is also estimated. A similar analysis is performed to compare fast neutron reactors (FRs) with LWRs. We review available information about various fuel cycle costs, as well as the quantities of uranium likely to be recoverable at a range of future prices. We conclude that the once-through LWR fuel cycle is likely to remain significantly cheaper than recycling in either LWRs or FRs for at least the next 50 yr, even with substantial growth in nuclear power.},

Presently, the TRR option has been industrially implemented in some European countries while the FRR option is still under development internationally. In this paper, the economic analysis of OTC and TRR options was carried out using levelized fuel cycle cost (LFCC). The two options were analyzed by calculating the equilibrium material flows as well as the economic costs of the overall fuel cycle components. The LFCCs of the two options were obtained as follows: OTC \$5.94±0.67mills/kWh and TRR \$6.13±0.55mills/kWh. Taking all uncertainties into considerations, the two options’ costs were in the same range. In addition, the sensitivity analysis was made to figure out the breakeven uranium price (\$112/kgHM), at which uranium price from OTC was economically competitive to TRR option slightly. Under the most possible international circumstance, it indicates a decreasing breakeven uranium price in future, which means TRR option would be more economical than OTC option.},

The long-term consequences of any decision regarding subjects such as fuel reprocessing, waste disposal, etc., require the use of strategic planning methods, in which provision is made for multiple objectives and for uncertainties. An interactive multicriteria approach using stochastic linear programming is provided by the code Strange, which has already been applied to different energy strategy problems, also outside the nuclear field. The application presented in the paper illustrates the search for a best fuel cycle policy including four criteria: production costs, the supply of raw material, the commercial balance and employment.

	abstract = {Fuel cycle simulators are used worldwide to provide scientific assessment to fuel cycle future strategies. Those tools help understanding the fuel cycle physics and determining the most impacting drivers at the cycle scale. A standard scenario calculation is usually based on a set of operational assumptions, such as reactor Burn-Up, deployment history, cooling time, etc. Scenario output is then the evolution of isotopes mass in the facilities that composes the nuclear fleet. The increase of computing capacities and the use of neutron data fast predictors provide new opportunities in nuclear scenario studies. Indeed, a very high number of calculations is possible, which allows testing a high number of operational assumptions combinations. The global sensitivity analysis (GSA) formalism is specifically well adapted for this kind of problem. In this new framework, a scenario study is based on the sampling of operational data, which become input variables. A first result of a scenario study is the highlight of relations between operational input data and outputs. Input variable subspace that satisfy optimization criteria on an output, such as plutonium incineration or stabilization, can also be determined. In this paper, a focus is made on the methodology based on GSA. This innovative methodology is presented and applied to a simple fleet simulation composed of a PWR-UOx fuel and a PWR-MOx fuel. Calculations are done with the fuel cycle simulator CLASS developed by the CNRS/IN2P3 in collaboration with IRSN. The design of experiment is built from five fuel cycle input sampled variables. Sensitivity indices have been calculated on plutonium and minor actinide (MA) production. It shows that the PWR-UOx Burn-Up and the fraction of PWR-MOx fuel are the most important input variables that explain the plutonium production. For the MA production, main drivers depend strongly on isotopes. Sensitivity analysis also reveals input variable subspace responsible of simulation crash, what led to an important improvement of the model algorithms. An equilibrium condition on the plutonium mass in the stockpile used for building MOx fuel has been applied. The solution is represented as a subspace in the PWR-UOx Burn-Up and PWR-MOx fraction input space. For instance, achieving a plutonium equilibrium in a stockpile fed by a PWR-UOx that operates at 40 GWd/t requires a PWR-MOx fraction between 9 and 14\%. This study also provides data related to plutonium incineration induced by the utilization of the MOx.},

	abstract = {Independent estimates assume that the world-wide civilian and military fissile material stocks amount to 500 tons of plutonium and 1,400 tons of highly-enriched uranium (HEU). To enable deep cuts in warhead arsenals, states will very likely need to verify declarations of fissile material stocks, as they could be used to build new nuclear weapons. One approach is nuclear archaeology, reconstructing the past production of those materials. Research has so far focused on specific measurements in reactors to assess past plutonium production, on deposits in gaseous diffusion plants and isotopics of depleted uranium tails to assess HEU production. For the large historical production of separated plutonium and HEU by Russia and the United States, uncertainties corresponding to large numbers of significant quantities remain with these techniques. A combination of measurements, fuel cycle simulations and reviews of records from past production activities could significantly reduce these uncertainties. This combination also would enable cross-checking information and measurement results for consistency. To demonstrate this approach, we conduct a case study. A declared production history is generated using the CYCLUS nuclear fuel cycle simulator. The simulation results are signatures resulting from the simulated history, some of which could in principle be measured. Assessing the isotopic compositions of waste streams, for example, can allow for cross-checking of declared fuel cycle histories. Based on this case study, the capabilities of the approach will be examined.},

	abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,…,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,…,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,…,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

	abstract = {Full text of publication follows: Decisions taken in the near term can have large consequences on the eventual outcomes of a chosen fuel cycle due to the long-time frames involved in the development, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and the storage of nuclear waste Numerous elements of future fuel cycles, such as the future nuclear energy demand and costs associated with future fuel cycle facilities that are not available commercially today, are not currently known, or not well-known Due to these uncertainties, many countries are currently evaluating potential future nuclear energy scenarios, employing fuel cycle scenario studies as a mechanism to inform decisions on future reactor types, fuel types, and other fuel cycle facilities Fuel cycle scenario studies are complex, involving many interconnecting components Many of the input parameters have large uncertainties However, not all uncertainties will have a significant impact on each of the evaluation metrics of the fuel cycle Certain evaluation metrics will be more sensitive to different input parameters The Nuclear Energy Agency's Expert Group on Advanced Fuel Cycle Scenarios has undertaken a study to evaluate the effects of the uncertainties of input parameters on the outcomes of fuel cycle scenario studies The goal of this work is to provide guidance on which input parameters it is important to investigate thoroughly and know well, and which components can be less well-known, given the objectives of a particular study Each participating member chose their own scenario code, the choices of which include: VISION, COSI, FAMILY, COSAC and EVOLCODE A simplified nuclear fuel cycle scenario was employed as a reference case to first ensure that all codes performed comparable analyses of the scenario, to identify any differences attributable to the modeling approaches between the codes, and to provide a baseline against which to evaluate sensitivities The reference scenario involves the transition from a fleet of UOX fueled PWRs to a fleet of MOX fueled FRs under a constant nuclear energy demand The sensitivities of output metrics such as resource consumption, enrichment requirements, plutonium and spent fuel inventories, and reprocessing capacity to the varied parameters were evaluated Varied input parameters include: nuclear energy demand and energy demand profile, spent nuclear fuel cooling time, fresh fuel fabrication time, date and rate of introduction of the fast reactors, fuel burnup, fuel composition (including the minor actinide content of the fast reactor fuel in case of MA transmutation), fast reactor breeding ratio, reactor lifetime, and introduction date, capacity, and losses of the reprocessing plant The results show how the output metrics are affected by the choice of scenario code, with an explanation of which assumptions underlie these effects The results also show the relative impact of each parameter on each output metric If the feasibility of the scenario in terms of fissile materials availability is threatened, possible adjustments of input parameters are explored (authors)},

	abstract = {An analytical decay heat model was developed to evaluate the US inventory of commercial spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The model was benchmarked against the results from ORIGEN-ARP 5.01. The new analytical SNF decay heat model was applied to actual (thru 2002) and projected SNF data. The total decay heat from the 63,000 MT commercial SNF at year 2012 was estimated at 182MW. According to the thermal loading analysis using a mountain-scale heat transfer model, a 4.9km2 (1165acre) site designated for SNF disposal was found to have the capacity to store more SNF than the statutory limit of 70,000 MTIHM. The maximum capacity available for SNF disposal at the Yucca Mountain site is dependent upon the thermal loading strategy chosen and SNF cooling time before emplacement. It was also shown that using high burnup SNF and adjusting the drift spacing, the capacity of the repository could be maximized on a per energy production basis, although some additional cooling may be necessary. Future work needs to consider extending the ‘footprint’ of the repository, applying non-uniform SNF loading into the drifts, and the impact of spent fuel reprocessing and other decay heat management strategies.},

	abstract = {Originally published in 1983, this book presents both the technical and political information necessary to evaluate the emerging threat to world security posed by recent advances in uranium enrichment technology. Uranium enrichment has played a relatively quiet but important role in the history of efforts by a number of nations to acquire nuclear weapons and by a number of others to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. For many years the uranium enrichment industry was dominated by a single method, gaseous diffusion, which was technically complex, extremely capital-intensive, and highly inefficient in its use of energy. As long as this remained true, only the richest and most technically advanced nations could afford to pursue the enrichment route to weapon acquisition. But during the 1970s this situation changed dramatically. Several new and far more accessible enrichment techniques were developed, stimulated largely by the anticipation of a rapidly growing demand for enrichment services by the world-wide nuclear power industry. This proliferation of new techniques, coupled with the subsequent contraction of the commercial market for enriched uranium, has created a situation in which uranium enrichment technology might well become the most important contributor to further nuclear weapon proliferation. Some of the issues addressed in this book are: A technical analysis of the most important enrichment techniques in a form that is relevant to analysis of proliferation risks; A detailed projection of the world demand for uranium enrichment services; A summary and critique of present institutional non-proliferation arrangements in the world enrichment industry, and An identification of the states most likely to pursue the enrichment route to acquisition of nuclear weapons.},

Simulating only a limited number of nuclides leads inevitably to some bias on the outputs of the depletion simulation. Most methods used are either implicit or dedicated to specific cases. This paper presents a new method, based on physics consideration and an explicit algorithm, that automatically selects isotopes and reactions for a depletion calculation. This method uses the creation and simplification of a nucleus tree gathering and linking together all nuclides that can possibly be created during the depletion process. This is performed by recursively adding nuclides possibly created from nuclides previously in the tree through decay or nuclear reaction. After the creation of the tree, it can be simplified by automatically cutting nuclides and reaction out through 3 processes: half-life threshold, cross-section threshold and reaction type cut. Using these simplification processes, the presented method leads to important calculation cost reduction (up to 40\%) with effect on outputs lower than 3 times their stochastic standard deviation.},

	abstract = {The Xe-100 is a high temperature, helium-cooled, graphite moderated, pebble bed reactor (HTGR) featuring a 6-times through, multi-pass (MEDUL = MEhrfachDUrchLauf) fuelling scheme. It is designed for delivering heat in the form of superheated steam at 565 °C and 16.5 MPa. This steam can be used to generate electricity, provide process heat for petrochemical application, or for cogeneration applications, such as the treatment of contaminated water resources, whilst simultaneously generating electricity. The design is characterized as a Generation IV reactor, with a core that cannot melt and featuring safety characteristics that will eliminate the need at any time to evacuate or displace the public, or that will cause unallowable contamination of the land. The technology is based on proven technology that has demonstrated these safety claims both experimentally and in commercial deployment. The foundation of proof ensures high levels of design and technical readiness. In the overview presented below a parametric comparison is offered of a 165 MWth design against that of X-energy’s 200 MWth reference Xe-100 design. The excess reactivity in both cases is shown to be limited by the continuous fuelling regime, whilst the core geometry and selected core power density enables passive heat removal. In this way the desired intrinsic safety design features of a typical GEN IV design are guaranteed. It is shown that even in the event of a depressurized loss of forced coolant (DLOFC) design basis event, no significant amount of radiological material will be released. A larger margin of tolerance is afforded in the 165 MWth design case, as expected. The coupled core neutronic and thermo-fluid dynamics design for the Xe-100 is performed with the VSOP-A and MGT systems of codes. For the equilibrium core, VSOP results demonstrate that the spherical fuel powers (maximum 3.0 kW) and operational temperatures ({\textless}1000 °C) fall well within the envelope of the design criteria. Adequate reactivity control and long-term, cold shutdown are provided by two separate, independently actuated systems, while the overall negative reactivity temperature coefficient is illustrated over the total operational range.},

	abstract = {The goal of this project, “ORIGEN-based Nuclear Fuel Depletion Module for Fuel Cycle Assessment" is to create a physics-based reactor depletion and decay module for the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator in order to assess nuclear fuel inventories over a broad space of reactor operating conditions. The overall goal of this approach is to facilitate evaluations of nuclear fuel inventories for a broad space of scenarios, including extended used nuclear fuel storage and cascading impacts on fuel cycle options such as actinide recovery in used nuclear fuel, particularly for multiple recycle scenarios. The advantages of a physics-based approach (compared to a recipe-based approach which has been typically employed for fuel cycle simulators) is in its inherent flexibility; such an approach can more readily accommodate the broad space of potential isotopic vectors that may be encountered under advanced fuel cycle options. In order to develop this flexible reactor analysis capability, we are leveraging the Origen nuclear fuel depletion and decay module from SCALE to produce a standalone “depletion engine” which will serve as the kernel of a Cyclus-based reactor analysis module. The ORIGEN depletion module is a rigorously benchmarked and extensively validated tool for nuclear fuel analysis and thus its incorporation into the Cyclus framework can bring these capabilities to bear on the problem of evaluating long-term impacts of fuel cycle option choices on relevant metrics of interest, including materials inventories and availability (for multiple recycle scenarios), long-term waste management and repository impacts, etc. Developing this Origen-based analysis capability for Cyclus requires the refinement of the Origen analysis sequence to the point where it can reasonably be compiled as a standalone sequence outside of SCALE; i.e., wherein all of the computational aspects of Origen (including reactor cross-section library processing and interpolation, input and output processing, and depletion/decay solvers) can be self-contained into a single executable sequence. Further, to embed this capability into other software environments (such as the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator) requires that Origen’s capabilities be encapsulated into a portable, self-contained library which other codes can then call directly through function calls, thereby directly accessing the solver and data processing capabilities of Origen. Additional components relevant to this work include modernization of the reactor data libraries used by Origen for conducting nuclear fuel depletion calculations. This work has included the development of new fuel assembly lattices not previously available (such as for CANDU heavy-water reactor assemblies) as well as validation of updated lattices for light-water reactors updated to employ modern nuclear data evaluations. The CyBORG reactor analysis module as-developed under this workscope is fully capable of dynamic calculation of depleted fuel compositions from all commercial U.S. reactor assembly types as well as a number of international fuel types, including MOX, VVER, MAGNOX, and PHWR CANDU fuel assemblies. In addition, the Origen-based depletion engine allows for CyBORG to evaluate novel fuel assembly and reactor design types via creation of Origen reactor data libraries via SCALE. The establishment of this new modeling capability affords fuel cycle modelers a substantially improved ability to model dynamically-changing fuel cycle and reactor conditions, including recycled fuel compositions from fuel cycle scenarios involving material recycle into thermal-spectrum systems.},

The purpose of this paper is to study the burnup distribution and characteristic in the equilibrium core for different multipass recirculation method. Understanding the reactor physics, in particular the burnup, is important for optimum design and safety analysis of nuclear reactor. Related with the design approval phase of RDE, this study provides a design data which needed for the RDE’s safety analysis report, e.g. fuel pebble performance analysis. Analysis in this study was performed using PEBBED diffusion code. PEBBED is designed to solve the neutronics and thermalhydraulics parameter cases for high temperature pebble bed reactors for different fuel recirculation including once-through-then-out (OTTO) and multipass scheme. The reactor core calculation was performed by applying multipass scheme with variation from 5 passes up to 15 passes. With energy and power as inputs, the calculations produce the burnup fraction at the end of the cycle and the fast and thermal neutron fluxes in 8 energy groups. The calculation results showed that the lowest 5 passes fuel recirculation pattern has the highest and lowest minimum discharged burnup value. This is related to the average power distribution in the core which means more passes will flatter the burnup distribution including the power distribution and also seen in the value of flux and power peaking factor produced. power peaking factor produced.},

The safety of HTGRs results, among other, from the nature of the nuclear fuel used in them in the form of coated TRISO particles (tri-structural-isotropic) and the reduction of the total amount of radioactive waste generated. This paper reviews numerous methods used to ensure the sustainable, feasible management and long-term storage of HTGR nuclear waste for the protection of the environment and society. The types of waste generated in the HTGR cycle are presented as well as the methods of their characterization, which are important for long-time storage and final disposal. Two leading nuclear fuel cycle strategies, the once-through cycle (direct disposal or open cycle) and the twice-through cycle (recycling or partially closed cycle), are discussed also in relation to TRISO spent fuel. A short review of the possibilities of treatment of TRISO spent nuclear fuel from HTGR reactors is made.},

	abstract = {The ENDF/B-VII.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of ENDF/B-VII.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication [M.

	abstract = {The serpentTools Python package is presented as a useful and efficient alternative for processing Serpent results. One positive attribute of Serpent is that many output files are exported directly in a MATLAB format, allowing for results to be loaded with minimal to no effort. However, some files for larger analyses may require immense amounts of memory to load and store all the data, leading to long wait times. To expedite the process of data handling and ease common analyses, the Computational Reactor Engineering lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology has released and is maintaining the serpentTools Python package: a set of data parsers and containers intended to streamline analysis with Serpent outputs. The parsers are capable of processing large outputs with ease, and yield all data to the user in a simple object-oriented framework. Data can be read into Python in comparable or better times than MATLAB, with the option to store only data needed for a specific purpose. Furthermore, common analyses are implemented directly into the package to expedite frequent analysis, including plotting meshed data and flux specta. serpentTools is designed to be a useful and practical manner by which the Serpent community can load and analyze data inside a Python environment. This paper presents the Python package, highlighting some basic features, and compares capabilities to similar platforms.},

Due to the expansion of the potential design space facilitated through additive manufacturing, reactor designers need to find methods, such as generative design, to explore the design space efficiently. In this defense, I will show that I successfully applied evolutionary algorithms to conduct generative reactor design optimization for a fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR). I achieved this through three distinct research efforts: 1) furthering our understanding of the FHR design’s complexities through neutronics and temperature modeling, 2) creating an open-source tool that enables generative design reactor optimization with evolutionary algorithms, and 3) applying the tool to the FHR to optimize for non-conventional geometries and fuel distributions},

For the purpose of parameter identification of a fed-batch cultivation of S. cerevisiae altogether four kinds of simple and four kinds of multipopulation genetic algorithms have been considered. Each of them is characterized with a different sequence of implementation of main genetic operators, namely, selection, crossover, and mutation. The influence of the most important genetic algorithm parameters—generation gap, crossover, and mutation rates has—been investigated too. Among the considered genetic algorithm parameters, generation gap influences most significantly the algorithm convergence time, saving up to 40\% of time without affecting the model accuracy.},

The ability to accurately predict fuel pin performance is an essential requirement for the MOX fuel test assembly design. Detailed radial fission power and temperature profile effects and fission gas release in the fuel pin are a function of the fuel pin’s temperature, fission power, and fission product and actinide concentration profiles. In addition, the burnup-dependent profile analyses in irradiated fuel pins is important for fuel performance analysis to support the potential licensing of the MOX fuel made from WG-plutonium and depleted uranium for use in U.S. reactors.The MCNP Coupling With ORIGEN2 burnup calculation code (MCWO) can analyze the detailed burnup profiles of WG-MOX and reactor-grade mixed-oxide (RG-MOX) fuel pins. The validated code MCWO can provide the best-estimate neutronic characteristics of fuel burnup performance analysis. Applying this capability with a new minicell method allows calculation of detailed nuclide concentration and power distributions within the MOX pins as a function of burnup. This methodology was applied to MOX fuel in a commercial pressurized water reactor and in an experiment currently being irradiated in the ATR. The prediction of nuclide concentration profiles and power distributions in irradiated MOX pins via this new methodology can provide insights into MOX fuel performance.},

	abstract = {In order to recycle potentially valuable uranium and plutonium, the Purex process has been successfully used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel for several decades now at industrial scales. The process has developed over this period to treat higher burnup fuels, oxide as well as metal
 fuels within fewer solvent extraction cycles with reduced waste arisings. Within the context of advanced fuel cycle scenarios, there has been renewed international interest recently in separation technologies for recovering actinides from spent fuel. Aqueous fuel processing research and development
 has included further enhancement of the Purex process as well as the development of minor actinide partitioning technologies that use new extractants. The use of single cycle Purex solvent extraction flowsheets and centrifugal contactors are key objectives in the development of such advanced
 Purex processes in future closed fuel cycles. These advances lead to intensified processes, reducing the costs of plants and the volumes of wastes arising. By adopting other flowsheet changes, such as reduced fission product decontamination factors, U/Pu co-processing and Pu/Np co-stripping,
 further improvements can be made addressing issues such as proliferation resistance and minor actinide burning, without adverse effects on the products. One interesting development is the demonstration that simple hydroxamic acid complexants can very effectively separate U from Np and Pu in
 such advanced Purex flowsheets.},

	abstract = {Advanced separations technology is key to closing the nuclear fuel cycle and relieving future generations from the burden of radioactive waste produced by the nuclear power industry. Nuclear fuel reprocessing techniques not only allow for recycling of useful fuel components for further power generation, but by also separating out the actinides, lanthanides and other fission products produced by the nuclear reaction, the residual radioactive waste can be minimised. Indeed, the future of the industry relies on the advancement of separation and transmutation technology to ensure environmental protection, criticality-safety and non-proliferation (i.e., security) of radioactive materials by reducing their long-term radiological hazard.Advanced separation techniques for nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatment provides a comprehensive and timely reference on nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatment. Part one covers the fundamental chemistry, engineering and safety of radioactive materials separations processes in the nuclear fuel cycle, including coverage of advanced aqueous separations engineering, as well as on-line monitoring for process control and safeguards technology. Part two critically reviews the development and application of separation and extraction processes for nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatment. The section includes discussions of advanced PUREX processes, the UREX+ concept, fission product separations, and combined systems for simultaneous radionuclide extraction. Part three details emerging and innovative treatment techniques, initially reviewing pyrochemical processes and engineering, highly selective compounds for solvent extraction, and developments in partitioning and transmutation processes that aim to close the nuclear fuel cycle. The book concludes with other advanced techniques such as solid phase extraction, supercritical fluid and ionic liquid extraction, and biological treatment processes.With its distinguished international team of contributors, Advanced separation techniques for nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatment is a standard reference for all nuclear waste management and nuclear safety professionals, radiochemists, academics and researchers in this field.A comprehensive and timely reference on nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatmentDetails emerging and innovative treatment techniques, reviewing pyrochemical processes and engineering, as well as highly selective compounds for solvent extractionDiscusses the development and application of separation and extraction processes for nuclear fuel reprocessing and radioactive waste treatment},

It is anticipated that PUREX will play an important role in upcoming and advanced future nuclear fuel cycles. The first objective of this chapter is to provide the background information required to status the present state of the art as currently practiced at the industrial scale. The second objective is to examine the modifications ready, or nearly so, for implementation into the next generation of PUREX reprocessing facilities, thereby further expanding the utility and operation of the process for use in nuclear fuel cycles of the future.},
