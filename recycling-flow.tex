    to advanced reactors with a recycle fuel cycle. Facilities in 
    red are added in for all of the transition scenarios. Facilities in green 
    are included in the transitions to continuous recycling. The separations facility
    is deployed in 2020, five years before the transition, and before 2020 a once-through 
    fuel cycle is used.}
