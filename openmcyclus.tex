This chapter details the methodology and structure of the ``OpenMCyclus'' 
reactor archetype to couple the depletion solver in OpenMC with 
\Cyclus. Previous efforts have been made to include depletion calculations 
in a \Cyclus archetype (\cite{skutnik_cyborg_2016}). However, these efforts 
are no longer supported or require access to software that is export controlled. 
By using the depletion solver in OpenMC \cite{romano_depletion_2021}, \Cyclus 
has the ability to incorporate depletion into a reactor facility model without 
the restrictions of export controlled or proprietary material. The full 
repository for this archetype can be found at \hl{Create Zenodo object}.

\section{Methodology}

Using the IndependentOperator in OpenMC, performs depletion. We use this class in 
OpenMC because it's faster than using the CoupledOperator, which performs a full 
transport calculation with the depletion. Required to create the 1-group cross 
sections, don't update the cross sections 

\section{Demonstration}
We demonstrated the new archetype using two problems: a once-through scenario with one 
type of reactor and a closed fuel cycle with two types of reactors. The first 
reactor type is a \gls{PWR} that produces 1000 MWe and requires fuel every 
18 months. The second reactor type is an \gls{HTGR} that produces 500 MWe and requires 
fuel every 12 months. In both scenarios, 2000 MWe is required. The results from each 
scenario include the plutonium inventory as a function of time at the reprocessing 
facility and the plutonium output from the reactors.
