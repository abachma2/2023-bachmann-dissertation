This dissertation would not have been possible without the support 
of numerous people. I would first like to thank my PhD advisor and 
committee chair, Dr. 
Madicken Munk. You helped me in many capacities, including technical 
mentorship, time management, and professional development opportunities 
to help prepare me for the next stages of my career. Without you, my PhD 
experience would not have been as enriching and rewarding. I would also like 
to thank my committee members: Prof. Jim Stubbins, Prof. Tomasz Kozlowski, 
Prof. John Abelson, and Dr. Bo Feng for their time and guidance on my dissertation. 

In addition to those on my committee, I received substantial mentorship from 
many others. I am grateful to Dr. Scott Richards for his mentorship while I 
was at Argonne National Lab. Without him, I would have been in graduate school 
for twice as long. I am also grateful to the \Cyclus community, namely Prof. 
Paul P.H. Wilson, Dr. Baptiste Mouginot, and Jin Whan Bae, for their warm 
welcome to the \Cyclus community and their support in helping me learn about 
fuel cycle simulators. Additionally, I am eternally grateful to Prof. 
Kathryn Huff, with whom I began my PhD journey. You helped me sculpt my 
dissertation, learn new skills, and explore new things. I would not be 
the researcher I am if I didn't have your guidance. 

I am incredibly thankful to all of the members of the \gls{ARFC} Research 
group for all of their guidance, support, and friendship -- 
Nathan Ryan, Sam Dotson, Sun Myung Park, Zo\"{e} Richter, Luke Seifert, 
Olek Yardas, Roberto Fairhurst-Agosta, Nataly Panczyk, Lu Kissinger, and 
Nicholas Yeung. A special thank you to Nathan Ryan, Nataly Panczyk, and Nicholas 
Yeung for their proof-reading of this document, and the others I wrote during my 
time in \gls{ARFC}. I would also like to acknowledge and thank all of the other 
UIUC NPRE students and communities that were part of my journey, as 
you all made grad school much more bearable, especially as we went through 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Fianlly, I would like to thank my parents, siblings, Kyle Anderson, and Little R
for all of the love and support each of you gave me throughout my journey.
