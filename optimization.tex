\section{Recycling optimization}

Optimization for this work means minimizing certain material requirements, 
specifically the \gls{HALEU} mass and the \hl{???}. This work performs three 
different optimization problems: minimize the \gls{HALEU} mass, minimize the 
\hl{???}, and minimizing both. 

\cite{andrianov_optimization_2019} minimized total discounted costs using 
the MESSAGE energy planning software. 

I get a general sense that a lot of work has been done to optimize fuel cycles 
for cost, unf management, or proliferation risk. Not seeing a whole lot on 
material requirements. 
Methods I'm seeing: genetic algorithms, linear programming, stochastic linear 
programming (same thing?)

Can I minimize the difference between average and maximum SWU capacity needed?
Set that difference as the objective function. Would want to look for global 
optimization. Do I need linear or non-linear methods?

I want to run a genetic algorithm optimization case in Dakota, see how all of 
that works, then develop my method (whatever that is). Compare the results, have 
that be a paper.
