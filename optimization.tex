\section{Methodology}
Optimization of the nuclear fuel cycle is intended to develop 
a fuel cycle based on a specific objective or objectives. For this 
work, we developed three different optimization problems to apply to 
Scenarios 7 (no growth, once-through transition to the \gls{MMR}, Xe-100, 
and VOYGR) and 14 (no growth, limited recycling transition to the 
\gls{MMR}, Xe-100, and VOYGR): minimizing the \gls{SWU} capacity to 
produce \gls{HALEU}, minimizing the mass of \gls{SNF} for disposal, 
and minimizing both the \gls{HALEU} \gls{SWU} and the \gls{SNF} 
mass. To optimize these transitions, we consider six different 
variables: percent of \glspl{LWR} operating for 80 years, the build share 
of Xe-100s, the build share of \glspl{MMR}, the build share of VOYGRs, 
the discharge burnup of the Xe-100, and the discharge burnup of the 
\gls{MMR}. All of these variables were considered in the sensitivity 
analysis. The transition start time was also considered in the sensitivity 
analysis. However, that analysis showed that the transition start time has
a much smaller impact on each of the metrics and delaying the transition 
can lead to unfulfilled energy demand. Therefore, this parameter is 
not considered in the optimization of each scenario. 

For this work, the percent of \glspl{LWR} operating for 80 years 
was constrained to between 0-50\% of the current \gls{LWR} fleet. 
The build share of each advanced reactor was allowed to range between 
0-100\%, but the three parameters had to sum to 100\%. The discharge burnups 
are restricted to the values considered in the sensitivity analysis.

We coupled \Cyclus \cite{huff_fundamental_2016} with Dakota 
\cite{adams_dakota_2019} to perform this optimization. For the 
single-objective problems, we used the ``soga'' solve method in 
Dakota, which is a single-objective genetic algorithm. For the 
multi-objective problems we used the ``moga'' solve method in 
Dakota, which is a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms
have previously been used to optimize fuel cycle transitions 
\cite{passerini_systematic_2014}, which led to the decision to use 
them for this work. Each of these methods have multiple 
hyperparameters that require careful tuning and selection. 

\subsection{Hyperparameter tuning}
Genetic algorithms have a variety of hyperparameters, such as the the 
population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate, that can affect 
the results of the algorithm. Therefore, we tuned multiple hyperparameters
to determine the best combination for this work and the exact algorithm 
used by Dakota. We performed the tuning by performing a grid search across 
the possible values for different parameters, a method recommended 
by Deb \cite{deb_multi-objective_2001}. Not all hyperparameters or 
all possible values of the hyperparameters were considered. We downselected from 
the possible hyperparameters and values defined in the Dakota Reference 
Manual based on personal intuition and limitations on time to perform 
the tuning. The 
first grid search performed 40 iterations of different hyperparameter 
values across a coarse grid. The total number of samples was restricted to 
500 for each evaluation, which restricts the population size and the 
number of generations, as the product of these two must equal the 
total number of samples.Table \ref{tab:soga_tuning} describes 
the hyperparameters considered in the tuning and the possible 
values they take. Some of the variables, such as the mutation 
type, take discrete values while others, such as the crossover 
rate, can take continuous values. The crossover rate, mutation 
rate, and constraint penalty were treated as continuous for this 
tuning, and therefore were randomly sampled within the defined range. 
The population size can be a continuous variable, but was 
treated as discrete for this initial search to provide a well-defined 
number of generations.

        Mutation rate & 0.01 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 0.2 & 0.025 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 0.19\\

Figure \ref{fig:soga_coarse_tuning} shows the results of the coarse tuning 
for the single objective problem. From these results, we observe that the 
\gls{HALEU} \gls{SWU} capacity tends to be lower with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a population size between 10 and 50
    \item an ``offset normal'' mutation type
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Results of coarse tuning for the single-objective 
    optimization.}
    \label{fig:soga_coarse_tuning}
\end{figure}

Five of the tuning runs reached the theoretical minimum for \gls{HALEU} \gls{SWU} 
capacity of 0 kg-SWU, which occurs when only the VOYGR is deployed. Four of the 
runs had a population size of 25 and one had a population size of 50. Three of 
them used an ``offset normal'' mutation 
type, while two used a ``replace uniform'' mutation type. The smallest mutation 
rate was 0.029 and the largest is 0.182, so this hyperparameter spans most of 
the space. The crossover rates ranges between 0.3-0.888. The constraint 
penalty ranges between 0.648-1.986, with four of the five runs having constraint 
penalties above 1.0. Based on this information, we ran another 20 tuning runs with 
a finer grid for some of the parameters, defined in the ``Fine Search'' column of 
Table \ref{tab:soga_tuning}, based on these results. 

Three of the fine tuning cases found the theoretical minimum. Observations about 
these cases include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All had a population size of 25
    \item The mutation rates varied between 0.123-0.166
    \item The crossover rates varied between 0.415-0.70, with two of the three 
          runs having crossover rates between 0.4-0.5
    \item The constraint penalty values ranged between 1.157-1.530
\end{itemize}
Combined with the observations from the coarse tuning, the hyperparameter 
tuning suggests that a population size of 25, a mutation rate above 
0.1, crossover rate between 0.4-0.7, and a constraint penalty 
between 1.1-1.6 should be used.  

In addition to hyperparameters, another consideration in the tuning process 
is how well the linear constraint of the problem (all of the advanced 
reactor build shares sum to 100) is met. According to the Dakota 
Reference Manual page for the ``SOGA'' optimization method, this 
optimization method does not always strictly adhere to any linear 
constraints defined by the user \cite{adams_dakota_2019}. In practice, 
this means that the constraint will not be met by every evaluation but the 
final solution will meet the constraint. Because not all evaluations 
adhere to the constraint, this method is likely to take more time and 
compute resources than the optimization methods in Dakota that will 
adhere to the constraint on every evaluation. 

The build share for the \gls{MMR} and Xe-100 are each under 1\% for all of 
the tuning runs that reached the theoretical minimum. While these values 
are not zero, the workflow applied rounded these values to zero, which resulted 
in none of these reactors being deployed and reaching the theoretical 
minimum for \gls{HALEU} {SWU}. The rounding of the build share values (which 
is also applied to the VOYGR build share) leads to an undersupply of 
power in all scenarios, because the largest VOYGR build share is 99\%. 
The undersupply of power demonstrates that fuel cycle modelers need to have 
a strong understanding of their assumptions, such as how numbers are rounded, 
when using the methodology for optimizing a fuel cycle. 


Based on the tuning performed, we selected values for each of the 
hyperparameters. Table \ref{tab:ga_parameters} defines the 
parameters used with the optimization schemes.

\cite{andrianov_optimization_2019} minimized total discounted costs using 
the MESSAGE energy planning software. 

I get a general sense that a lot of work has been done to optimize fuel cycles 
for cost, unf management, or proliferation risk. Not seeing a whole lot on 
material requirements. 
Methods I'm seeing: genetic algorithms, linear programming, stochastic linear 
programming (same thing?)
